It's simple and just satisfying.The board is not as small as I thought it would be. Mind you, it's not HUGE but it's a good size to take it on the go and not worry about taking up too much space. Not only that but it seems to be sturdy enough to being dropped a few times on the ground and still be in one piece.The clicking of the metal balls, when using the magnetic pen, is so satisfying. More so, when you poke or drag your fingers across to push the metal balls back down to 'erase' it. And speaking of the pen, I love how when you slide the pen in, to put it up in the slot above the drawing board, there seems to be a magnet inside to snap the pen into place and hold it so it isn't able to slide out so easily.So far it stood up to being thrown, beaten, and used this long and its still in one piece.

This is one of her favorite new toys, and Dad likes it, too!This is such a clever toy. You use a ""pen"" with a magnetic tip to attract steel balls to the surface of a grid. As you do so, the bee-bees make a distinct ""clack"" which reinforces a child's efforts to create. With a 21 x 23 hole grid, you can make a tremendous variety of geometric designs and images.When you are done drawing, you push the steel balls down to start over. This can be hard on your fingers, if you do it with your bare hands. However, it works great to use either the side or the plain tip of the ""pen.""Measuring 6 x 7.5 x about 3/4 inches, it's the perfect size for traveling. It's also lightweight and portable. The plastic pen stores in a slot of the Magnatab screen. Our daughter can enjoy it in the back seat during a long drive--provided Mom doesn't go crazy from the sound!The price is right, too. For about $10, this makes a great stocking stuffer for Christmas for kids young and old.",false,"[]"

The Free Draw version is small (6x7), which you would think would be good for travel, but it is too loud to take out to a restaurant or on an airplane. I also find it too small to draw much of anything. It is fine for basic shapes, writing 1 or 2 letters at a time, then erase and try again. We even tried tic-tac-toe without much success. It was very hard to fit the X‘S and O’s and have them legible.I have added a video to show you how basic shapes work for an adult. In the pictures, that is a Christmas tree.If you keep it simple, it may be perfect for you. It’s great for fine motor skills. Many children fear making a mistake when writing the alphabet.

They'll sit there for extended periods of time and really focus as they click those little balls into place.I'll also mention that it seems sturdy and well-made, and is very easy to use for just about anyone.That said, it's not perfect. For one, it's pretty difficult to draw anything with too much detail - you'll be making more rough representations or designs than you will detailed art/drawings (or, maybe we're just not good at it!) But the biggest downside is that this toy is loud – and I'm talking LOUD! Most art toys are great in that they keep kids quiet while engaged, but not this one. The balls click pretty loudly when they ""jump up,"" and they're especially loud when being erased with the stylus (and of course, kids will use this as a maraca whenever they can...) Seriously, don't underestimate how loud this thing is - and I haven't even used it in the cramped quarters of a car yet!I'll also note that the price seems a little high to me, as this toy is relatively small and simple.

This thick plastic keeps the toy from flexing at all and unless you run it over with a car, there won't be any breaking. The screws on the back are safety screws so that older, enterprising kids don't get any wise ideas. The pen locks onto each ball quickly and strongly and as it pulls it to the top of the little barrel it sits in, it stays there. Every now and then you need to lock on to a ball twice in order to get it well seated, but it's no big deal. For me, the bigger entertainment is pushing the balls back down once you're done drawing.

Although this one allows you to draw whatever you want, there is almost too many beads too close together. Sometimes the metal balls want to slot in themselves (without the pen) and sometimes they refuse to stay put (with the pen). Sometimes you have to have the ball meet the pen in which case, there is a tougher magnetic pull and the pen doesn't flow as naturally as in the other versions. The board is smaller than I expected, so you're sort of limited on what to ""draw"" and because of this, the toy does not hold focus as long as the other Magnatab puzzles.However, there are still so many features which make it a four star review for me. First, it has a very calming ""feel"" to it. It reminds me of a pin-art board in terms of how it feels on your hand. Of course, these are balls and not pins, so it is both safer and a little more relaxing and welcoming. Second, the sound the balls make when they click into place is very euphonious, and the sound when they are not in their slot reminds me of a rainmaker. This is a great ""time-out"" toy for kids; they can calm down while still using their imaginations through hands-on play. I also think the ingenuity of the toy makes it interesting to kids. My children (7, 5 and 2) are drawn to this toy, especially when they have to have calm/quiet time.",false,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lMP1gOfnL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61tfveERa1L._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Honestly, I wasn't sure what I was getting when I ordered it, but it is a plastic and steel-ball-bearing and magnet grid-based toy that can be used for drawing, spelling, and just free-entertainment play. Essentially, it is a big binary pixel system of drawing, where great imagination and innovation can be had in the backseat of a car – from tic-tac-toe to guess the picture to practice with letters and numbers. In the images I shared, I am showing my 6 and 11-year-old’s interpretation of Spongebob, the Harry Potter icon, and a free-drawn masterpiece. It is like those magnetic whiteboards with the iron filings from the nineties, but since the device is so binary with the ball bearing being either activated or deactivated, there will never be any screen burn, the pieces will never tire or get worn out, and since the kids can return the styl8us back to the device, it will never get lost.Overall, a great little toy that can be used educationally, recreationally, and interpersonally. Perfect for the living room, the back seat, or the classroom!",false,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LhEl0ErdL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OpI2C+NvL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zM1B4ps6L._SL1600_.jpg""]"

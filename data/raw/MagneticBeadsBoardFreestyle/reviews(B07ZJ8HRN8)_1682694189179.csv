They're much better than the erasable pressure-based magnetic drawing pads you might be more familiar with in some ways. The ball bearing matrix offers much better precision and kids can be more meticulous with each dot. Running the pen over the tablet quickly also works. We like open-ended toys that encourage creativity.The pen tip is magnetic and sucks the ball bearing into a hole. To ""erase"" just push the ball back down with fingers. A booklet of drawings is included if your child needs ideas.Things that could be improved upon: The tablet should have a handle for easier carrying by little hands. The pen should also have an optional tether. Also, I think the plastic could stand to be a bit thicker.If you're looking for more of these kinds of dot tablets, Apfity has ones that teach how to write letters and number: Apfity Magnetic Alphabet Letter Tracing Board, ABC Magnetic Tablet Drawing Board for Kids, Magnetic Letter and Number Tracing Board for Toddlers Preschoolers.",false,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JAk3AuK3L._SL1600_.jpg""]"

It comes with a magnetic stylus that, when touched to a perforation, pulls a ball up into the hole. Keep touching perforations to ""draw"" with the magnetic balls. The balls are all silver so color is not possible but you can create some surprisingly complex drawings with this toy. To ""erase"", just run your finger along the balls and they fall back into the box.The perforations are small so it's not possible to pull a magnetic ball out through the holes. The plastic box is very strong so I have no worries about durability under normal play situations. There is a magnetic indent on the front that holds the stylus securely when not in use.This is a good toy for riding in the car or for solitary play. Since no color is possible, it likely will not engage kids for hours but I think it's well worth the $12 price tag.",false,"[]"

It doesn't easily stay in place/go into place for my 3 and 5 year old.2) The tip of the magnet pen rubbed off and was no longer magnetic after about 2 days - we were very disappointed.3) The balls also started ""sticking"" and didn't fall back down into the holes.It is SUCH a cool idea and I actually found a different brand that I REALLY love that doesn't have those issues and feels like a really great quality product.Overall, I think this particular toy had great potential and maybe we got a fluke or something, but even if that was the case, I still think the design could use some work as far as the pen attachment goes. I would not personally purchase this item again or recommend it:(",false,"[]"

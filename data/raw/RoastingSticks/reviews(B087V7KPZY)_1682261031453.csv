Old one on the left, new on the right. The one on the right is what I call sturdy.Several reviews said these were sturdy and I’m baffled by this. I’m sure they’d hold a marshmallow, but they are super flimsy. About as sturdy as if you’d unraveled a wire coat hanger and used a single strand of wire. The only benefit is you could cook 2 of them with this? I bought this thinking I could cook hotdogs and brats like I do with my old one, but these wouldn’t hold one up. If you only plan on cooking marshmallows which are mostly air, they’ll probably be fine.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JwZxjRrrL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Easy to clean, if you do so right away. Nice it comes with a storage bag to keep together and being collapsable is a space saver. Length is perfect. If you want something more heavy duty, larger/longer prongs for double marshmallows, hotdogs, brats and better suitable for adults I’d look for another option. Overall great price for our minimal and simple use though.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71UGSqjXyBL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mFpF+doiL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wSBGCSAVL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Only complaint I have is cleaning it - the charcoal/char residue won’t come off and I have tried numerous things but it’s okay overall useful for the price !",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715loS99BtL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ONnyJrzdL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

I like to build massive fires and the telescoping length of these was a huge plus to not burn my face off while making smores. They are heavier-duty steel compared to others I've used. All around a great addition to my camping gear.",false,"[]"

These are extendable, easy to clean, rainbow colored and hold up really well. We made several rounds of a s’mores last night and then cleaned them right up, shortened them, back in the case they went. They aren’t sharp so they’re great for kiddos too! Super pleased with this buy actually.",false,"[]"

Each one has a different color handle, so everyone knows which roasting stick is theirs. Double prongs on the end with a little rubber caps – be sure not to lose the caps. Comes with a handy Storage bags, so no worries about them getting scattered when not in use. They telescope out really, really long. You can stand a good ways away from the campfire with these. Can roast one weenie or two marshmallows! I do not recommend adding another weenie, or trying to roast anything heavier than one weenie. These aren’t heavy duty and will start to droop if you put too much weight on the end. Definitely supervise children with them because 1. you’ll probably be around a campfire and you need to supervise kids around fire anyway and 2. you don’t want the kids to sword fight with these and poke each other’s eyes out. Very happy to have these to use around the fire pit at my place. Can’t wait for the next clear evening together around the fire and use these!",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OH9Q6ZTSL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712kORTQcaL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AKoKelhrL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I5h+F-hUL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ikBUWPNyL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

My property however is nothing but pine trees and whittling those branches down for roasting sticks aren't really the best for taste so I got these instead. I like that each one is a different color so there aren't any mix ups as to which goes to which person. The forks are strong and durable without being too heavy and the telescoping handles are ridiculously long, but that's great as it means you don't have to get too close to the fire (great for kids). Overall I'm very happy with these and can't wait to use them.",false,"[]"

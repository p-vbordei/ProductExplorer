Bulging on both sides not worth it","Putting this together alone is possible. Just donâ€™t tighten the bolts and you will have the wiggle room needed. Tighten everything once you have all together.Now on to the quality and stability of this planter. Itâ€™s tin. The brackets they give for the middle support beams are cheap bendable aluminum. They do not support this bed from bulging. The sides( Tin) - bend very easily.I will say that after I have it together 24 hrs and filled,it just continued to bulge and I donâ€™t even have the bottom filled with soil. I put 8 cinderblocks in it and some logs with room around the perimeter for light back filling. I feel that once the soil that was added to it to fill the planter will only continue to cause bulging once it gets wet. There is just no actually support with this planter. I would return but now I can not so it is garbage. I wasted hours of time and money on this product. Now I have to start over. Should of just bought a solid raised container.",false,"[]"

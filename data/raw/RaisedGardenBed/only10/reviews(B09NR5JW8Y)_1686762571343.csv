Must buy!","This garden bed has been very durable this fair.It was a little tedious to assemble alone, but is rather simple if you have a screwdriver.I was able to carry it easily out to my backyard.We dug out the incline and packed dirt around it to help keep it in place.It is very deep which is great for hugelkultur-style gardening.I plan on buying another soon!I love that it's brown because it fit right in with the natural look we hope to achieve throughout our backyard.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91YSqdTV0nL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Small and low to the ground, and fit perfectly on either side of my door.My one worry always with metal raised beds is I'm in Florida and everything rusts and warps. So far, even after 3 straight weeks of rain, these are holding up nicely.The bed is easy to put together by yourself, I have a back injury and this assembly was within my range of motion and pain level, and you don't have to reach for your electric screwdriver to put the bolts in place.It's good quality, affordable, has a small presence and pretty asthetic.I'm planning to buy 3 more for the other side of the patio.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91BsAAyGcWL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91IvibdI-hL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91OpwXuunHL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91aDW6cWihL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

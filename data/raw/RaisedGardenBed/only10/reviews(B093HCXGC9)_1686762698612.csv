"RTYDRYQW1Y457","B093HCXGC9","B0BGND2M55","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on May 22, 2023","May 22, 2023",1684710000,"Brandon N.",2,"Its not 8x4x2","So to start this whole thing took over a month but in the end I will say the company did make it right.I am however writing this review to warm people who may be fooled how I was. The listing says the bed is 8x4x2 after that it then says its 22"" the bed is not 24"" tall as advertised and I was informed by the company this is to ""make it easier for customers to find"" That is bologna. The bed is not 2 ft tall and if you are putting it in a garden full of 2ft tall beds it is very noticeable. As an attempt to fix this issue I was sent out another bed. The second bed of course was also not 2ft tall but it also had paint issues and rust when I opened the box. I ended up throwing the bed away as I live in south Florida and the sun and humidity is not kind to anything.That being said after over a month of back and forth I was given back my money.Now here is the hard part. The one bed I do have is amazing. The build quality the strength everything. Its one of my favorite beds in my entire garden, but lying about its size and then sending me a rusty bubbled bed was sadly enough for me to look elsewhere for my raised beds.If you are looking for raised beds and do not care if they are 24"" tall then these are an incredible option I really wish it was the right height. I will say though check your beds when you get them, you may also get one with bubbling paint and starting to rust and for me its unacceptable for something that is supposed to live its entire life outside. As long as the height doesn't matter to you and you are conscious that it may have some manufacturer defect I would recommend these beds. They are well built easy to assemble and sturdy as all get out once built and filled. I really wish I hadn't had these issues because I would love to make my entire new garden out of these beds I absolutely love the way they look.",false,"[]"

Robison",4,"Look dubstantial","I purchased four of the 4 x 8 x 2 beige beds. Nice powder coat and didnâ€™t scratch. Tops and bottoms are rolled so not sharp. Nog as as thin as most beds. Wish was better way than all those screws snd wing nuts. First box had two extra fasteners!The supports look good . Only reason I dinged them is for their poor directions!Where do you startâ€¦put sides together with wing nuts on inside. Then do short edges. Lastly put the supports in. Tighten all. Delivery was quick. Iâ€™d buy again provided they last.",false,"[]"

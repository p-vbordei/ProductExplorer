The height is great. The metal is a little flimsy for the weight of all of the dirt that needs to go into it.

It’s deeper than I need, so to save soil for this type of raised bed, we place small twigs and leaves about a foot deep and then add the soil. This process enriches the soil as the twigs and leaves turn into compost. We then add more soil from our large compost pile as needed.",false,"[]"

Once put together, this is a very deep piece with no bottom.My husband is worried about the amount of material it will take to fill and his concern is once filled that the piece will bow.Pretty flimsy metal and we are not sure if it will hold up or not.However, we are going to find a spot in the yard and give it a try.",false,"[]"

It took a while with all the screws and wing nuts, about 45 of them. Love the tan color. Seems like it will hold the soil well with the corner, center and middle braces.

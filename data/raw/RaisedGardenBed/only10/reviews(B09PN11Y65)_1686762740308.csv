But it will cut you if you aren’t careful. More importantly it is not easy to assemble unless you enjoy hurting your hands with all the screws. There are so many - and 30 minute assembly is laughable.It will get filled with dirt and plants eventually but I would not buy another. Was planning on 3 of these. Nope.

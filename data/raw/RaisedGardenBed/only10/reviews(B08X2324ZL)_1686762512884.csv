It took an extra hour for assembly and I still did not have bolts for the last three screws.If this were not an issue, assembly would have been seamless and much less stressful.",false,"[]"

Ideally you'd want a 2nd person to hold up the sides while you connect the ends, but you can lean it against a couch or chair. I recommend filling via the ""hügelkultur"" method to make your job of filling easier and less expensive - this will take a LOT of soil otherwise. Be sure to insert the center cross bar midway, and not too close to the top or bottom, otherwise the sides will bow out after it's filled. The height is great for those with bad backs!",false,"[]"

It is tedious and annoying to do. Takes longer than actual assembly. Was also missing some hardware for all 3 of these that I purchased. Seller shipped new hardware when contacted but should have been in the box from the beginning.",false,"[]"

The bolts had burrs, threads that were messed up but most disappointing is the center brace that keeps trying to fold up while installing. I would NOT recommend this except the size is good for what I needed it for.",false,"[]"
"R3SVWCMKZBABHL","B08X2324ZL","","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2023","June 5, 2023",1685919600,"H Sanders",5,"Fabulous!","I purchased a 6x3x2, 8x2x2 & 4x2x2.They were fairly easy to assemble.Much easier for 2 people especially the larger 2.They look beautiful and are easier to work on after they are planted since they are 2 ft off the ground.I am 72 years old and love them.I have only planted the 6ft one since I am waiting on getting top soil for the other 2.I really like the rubber gasket that goes around the top since the edges are sharp.I wish the gasketwas just a bit longer.I cut the sides a little bit short so I could cover the corners with the left over gasket from the 4 sides. Since they are so big, even the 4ft one, it does take a lot to fill them with soil unless you have mulch, branches, etc. to help fill the space. Since I have notplanted the 8ft and 4ft ones, I am putting all my lawn clippings in them to help fill them up so I won't have to have as much top soil.I would highly recommend this product.",false,"[]"

It can be rather blinding.All in all, I'm happy with it and looking forward to getting my plants in it.",false,"[]"

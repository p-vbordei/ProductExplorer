Side portions all protected by removable film. I had no trouble peeling film off. All parts were in the box, none missing, plus a couple extra screws and wing nuts. It was helpful to have two people so one could hold part in place, while he other secured it together. Not difficult, but easier with 2. Directions were clear. All finished and full of new plants!",false,"[]"

All garden beds do that, and I can't imagine there will be a big difference in how that happens, so instead I'll be talking about assembly, shipping, etc.Overall, I am a happy customer!They are exactly as described, and even look exactly like in the pictures, minus all the pretty foliage. I ordered the green ones simply for aesthetics, but I can't imagine the color of the metal changes anything. There were no issues with shipping, and both beds were delivered within the estimated time frame. (I ordered two.)Assembling these garden beds was astoundingly simple! For one thing, you don't need any heavy-duty equipment. You barely even really need a screwdriver; I just used one to tighten the bolts. But these beds are entirely assemblable by hand, which is always a huge win for me! The instructions themselves were simple and easy to follow, though if you require wording to accompany images to properly understand what is being shown, that might be a slight problem. Otherwise, everything about these beds was stream-lined, and I am quite happy!",false,"[]"

Then we saw these garden planters and thought we wouldgive it a try. The only draw back that I saw was the amount of soil that it takes to fill the bed. We went with bagged top soil and at last count we were up to 28 bags and the beds not full yet. If you have access to a load of top soil, that would solve that problem. Our plants are looking good but you need to keep them watered. We should be enjoying fresh tomatoes in a month or so.",false,"[]"

One corner of the box on arrival was crushed in and so was the product but we were able to straighten the pieces enough to use them. Its not the sturdiest metal.It was easy to put together and we liked not needing tools.My only concern is the bolts and wing nuts will likely rust out. Stainless steel fasteners would be a better method.But as i said, overall it is good.",false,"[]"

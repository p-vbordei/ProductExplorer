One galvanized and two brown. These are simple to assemble and I love that they have support brackets inside to keep the sides from bowing. I’ve only had them up for a month and a half but so far they are holding up great! I filled the bottom with twigs, leaves, grass clippings, peat moss, and straw so I wouldn’t have to purchase so much soil. Then I did a mixture of topsoil and raised bed potting mix for the top. I did about a foot of soil and the rest was compost. So far it’s working out great! My plants are growing larger than ever this year! Now if only I could keep out the dang squirrels!!",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91B1VoCV6UL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

The first one took four hours. I was hopeful that the second would go faster, but it was still about the same time. I did both of them by myself. In the reviews people speak of holes not aligning. In general they don’t. Most of the problems are with side panels that become somewhat flattened during shipping. I found that if you do the top and bottom screws first, then the middle, that the rest will slip right in. Now, it’s not always trivial to get the top and bottom done and someone to help would make it much easier, but it can be done! Just a note, they give you gloves, but you really can’t wear them while you install screws and the unfinished edges are really sharp! (Yes, I did manage to cut myself!)The other thing that I would like to point out is that the assembled containers are very large and that they require a huge amount of solid material to fill them. I’m talking about 30 cubic feet or so! At typical prices you should figure more than $100 worth of filler, each! (Maybe more!)The finished product is attractive and very functional and I can recommend them, but be warned about the assembly and the cost of filling them.",false,"[]"

In the background you can see the smaller bed I ordered earlier. It was smaller than expected, so that's why I ordered the larger one. Both were easy to assemble. I was able to assemble them alone. However, that said the larger one does come with instructions that I should have paid closer attention to.It comes with two different sizes of bolts, which I discovered after having it partially finished. I had replace thebolts I'd used, but that was my error. I'm very excited to begin gardening. I would definitely buy these again.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/911mYi7YDEL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91y-iPEUhqL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Super easy to put together. It took 45 minutes for three of us to assemble. It helps to have an electric drill to help tighten all the screws. I especially liked the center supports on the 8 x 4 size. The top edge is rolled to prevent any sharp edges, but they also give you a heavy rubber trim piece to head to the top. Absolutely no complaints. We’re anxious to finish filling and see how they hold up but I doubt if therewill beproblems.",false,"[]"

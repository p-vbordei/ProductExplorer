When I opened it there were gloves and tools included. Very easy to put together and excellent design. Very sturdy! I am 58 yo female and put it together by myself. Looking forward to filling it up and growing my veggies! Highly recommend. Have another in on it’s way and will buy more.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71B--OQYnML.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4D73X1SGK9F3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

Only change I'd make to the design is I would add a support in the center so the panels so they don't bulge when dirt is put in them.Overall:  I would recommend and I would buy again.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61861bWHNCL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JF8VJ6F3D658/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

There is a short retaining wall along the sidewalk that runs across the front of our house. A raised bed would be easy to plant and maintain, and would  plan allow the plantings to be easier to see as they would be two feet higher than the ground.  The 4ft wide by 8ft long (2 feet high) looks to be ideal.The box included ten section which were easy to put together, two straight panels on each side and three curves for each end. I would recommend you use an electric drill or impact driver rather than a standard screw driver or the little screw driver that came with it. Because of the shape of the horizontal ridges, you do not need a wrench to hold the nut. Using your fingers to hold the nut while running an impact driver was the best approach.The holes for each panel are drilled with precision so there was not wrestling to get all the screws and nuts in place. And while the edges of the panels are sharp, the top and bottom edges (the parts you grab with you hands when putting in place) have rounded edges. For safety's sake, the box included gloves which you could use when unpacking or carrying. I did not use them.Next step will be filling the raised bed with organic material, top soil and them plants. Looks to be an ideal solution and well made.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OBVTA8KY6M1E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

As it is currently, I will buy two more once the price drops back down to something more reasonable.  They have gone up about 20% in price in just the last two months.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31Q5R0IUO0CHF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

Easy enough though. However, two concerns: the bolts are rusting after a month. Second, I decided to string wire around a couple pairs of bolts from side to side in order to help support it. It bows out in the middle when filled with soil. Had I done it over, I would have added this support a few more times, as I'm concerned about the longevity of the center side walls.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F9EQS71WDVSL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

I find this to be a fair price for a bed of this size. I would not buy it for 175$ or whatever price that is higher than 119$. Why? Because for a few bucks more, I could get a 32 inch version that has paint protecting. These are bare metal which I do assume will last quite a few years, I hardly expect to last longer than the aforementioned.That being said. This bed is great. It's very thick and heavy steel. You can treat it yourself if you're worried about rust which will cost extra money but give you the same results as one that is already painted.The only reason I took stars off is due to that reason and the price without coupon. If I were going to consider this at full price, I would just go one step better and grab the painted ones.This also does not come with rubber edging which in my opinion, is needed. These get very hot in the summer to the touch also again, because it's not painted.So, do I recommend these? That is a resounding yes IF you get them for around 119$. Otherwise, I would not recommend them for the reasons already mentioned. 24 inches is a pretty perfect height for gardening and should keep a lot of unwanted animals out.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IS0TDFVYV8XQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ","B0BG2HP1PJ","Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）"

These garden beds worked perfectly. I love the dark wood look and that they'll last much longer than real wood! Bought two 8x4 ft beds for planting vegetables and was so happy with those that I bought a 4x4 ft bed to plant herbs.I put all three garden beds together by myself without any big issues. The set comes with screws, wingnuts, and washers. I screwed the screw and wingnut together with my hands and then used a screwgun and a pair of pliers to tighten everything together. I highly recommend wearing some thick gloves, pants, and closed-toed shoes because the metal pieces have super sharp edges that will cut you if you're not careful. Also, each metal piece is covered with a thin layer of plastic. Make sure you peel the plastic off before screwing the pieces together!Overall, I love the quality of these garden beds and you really can't beat the price!",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PnJQEwu9L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RWRNWRY7T0SM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM5ZJWQP","-","-"

It came with white cloth gloves that were handy as I did cut myself on the metal before being safe and putting the gloves on.

The only BIG issue I had were the pieces that join together the walls were very VERY stuck together. I had to get help from my dad to get them apart safely and not ruin them. I also thought this would be an easy issue to fix? Possibly putting a piece of packaging to keep them from resting into place. One other issue, is the packaging is very low waste, which is great for me, but could be bad for other shoppers who have rough delivery people.

These were very easy to assemble and look really nice in the yard. There's only one feature that I don't particularly care for, but it shouldn't be noticeable once the bed is full of plants. To preserve the faux wood finish, the sheets of metal come with a protective plastic covering, which I believe is intended to stay on the product (versus just for shipping purposes). On both raised beds that I purchased, there are lots of areas along the top edge where the plastic has bubbled or peeled, but it is not visible on the majority of the product.

Despite being flimsy and thin material (but good quality), it was easy to assemble and the wrench included is not needed. There is no bottom to this so if you are using this in an apartment I suggest getting a tarp or garden fabric to line the base.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2022","Hawke","yes","-","Really a pretty sturdy bed compared to two others.","So, this is bed number 3 I ordered.  First thing I don't understand is how they say use gloves and actually provide you a pair when the screws, washers and bolts are so small that is almost an impossibility.  So that made putting it together a little difficult to put together.  I thought the directions were very simple to understand yet the timeframes they give you on putting these together is ridiculous.  This one is much sturdier yet some pieces were bent and/or damaged yet box was not damaged.  I would like to see bigger hardware to simplify and speed up the assembly.  I do like the fact that is has a lip around the top and bottom, especially the top and the cross braces seem to be a lot sturdier.  They should include a couple more of them.  Bed 1 and this one are in the running yet still looking at others hoping to find one that is sturdy, simple to assemble.  I always put cardboard down in these beds first and some flakes of old crappy hay.  Then added top soil/compost/manure.  This one took14 1 cu. ft bags yet will need more once it settles down.  Wanted to include some peat moss yet everyone seems to be out of stock on that one.  I would recommend purchasing this bed because of its sturdiness.

This garden bed was very easy to put together, and it looks great, but the metal is a little thin. All together nice bed for the price. I do wish it came with an optional netting attachment like some of the others I saw.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KDCoLTXqL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE61YYQFU4D34/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM5ZJWQP","-","-"
"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023","NancyNancy","yes","-","Wasn’t as bad as I thought to put together","This came quickly but to ship it USPS just doesn’t make sense.  It was clearly tossed around and the long sections were deformed which made it challenging to get the screw holes lined up.  I did finally complete it after whittling away at it all afternoon.I was glad for the Prime Deal or special pricing, but do reconsider how it’s shipped.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nqf1z7C0L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ1Q6BHS8L6FY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM5ZJWQP","B09NR5JW8Y","Color: Silver | Size: 6x3x2FT"

"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2022","Mark T. SkeenMark T. Skeen","yes","yes","unexpectedly impressed for a good value.","We researched materials for our raised beds for a very long time.  My wife had a vision for her vegetable garden and was incredibly disappointed when we finally decided her first choice material of cedar was going to be just too expensive.  We thought galvanized would be our next option but she really didn't want the look of the steel so we opted for the black.  We saved (literally)hundreds by going with these black galvanized beds and we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed with the entire experience.  While waiting for the order we spent a lot of time watching youtube videos about ""mistakes"" and the ""hassles"" of putting together galvanized beds, and honestly, made ourselves anxious for no reason.Putting these beds tother IS time-consuming but NOT hard.  The larger 4X8 beds are easier with two people (just because of the number of screws and bolts you have to use and lining up the longer side pieces) but my wife actually did the 4X4 beds herself in under an hour each.So don't let the videos or other negative experiences scare you off.  That said here are some tips I'd advise:Most importantly- the flatter your surface the better the beds are going to sit and look. We did a lot of leveling before placing the beds and you can clearly see where we did a better job than not.  (I would also advise putting these beds together on a flat hard surface such as a patio, driveway, etc, then placing them where you want. It just makes lining up the pieces SO much easier)Here's what I learned from other reviewer's experiences that are worth paying attention to:  the reviewer ""runtails"" gave great advice in saying ""it is important although not immediately obvious, that the four corner pieces are oriented so the holes for the stability poles are all down"" and I would not have even noticed that had I not read that review first (and probably would have ended up having to take apart and put back together pieces)I also read a few reviews talking about receiving damaged products or the material ""scratching"" easily. Fortunately, we received all 4 of our beds in perfect condition and because I had read about the scratching, we were very careful in handling the pieces so they didn't scratch. We even kept the plastic coating lining the pieces until they were assembled and placed and I think this helped.We purchase 4 beds for about what it was going to cost us to build 2 cedar beds and I am thrilled with how it turned out.  Not only would I not hesitate to recommend these beds, but we'll also be ordering more beds next season to add.  They work well and are esthetically beautiful and I can't wait to get the paths mulched and the area fenced in.  As my wife noted, ""this is going to look even better than I envisioned!""",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FlJwWyn8L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TCHkwzgNL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UYSefW9SL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YnxYS3YNL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JKRKNJZKLS3L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67","B09SQZJV67","Color: Gray"

I had to bend back and damage them to be able to assemble. The metal pieces are all plastic covered to avoid damage (awesome) which seems great but as soon as it is removed the surface will scratch VERY easily. I will probably have to paint. I expected more for the cost.Update: One year after install there are several sections with significant rust creating holes on the sides.  I am going to paint with a rust protector in hopes of extending the life of the raised garden, but after only one year this might be a bust.",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oPn4bH3KL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xfM2ViliL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71diHXJm+kL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JIIDUD9LHKRW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67","B09SQZJV67","Color: Gray"
"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","Angela","yes","yes","Pretty good with some caveats","We just put 4 of these raised garden beds together over the weekend.Pros: easy to move, fairly easy to put together with 1 person. Looks niceCons: Instructions don't call out that the hole needs to be at the bottom for the stakes. The rubber top seems like it will come off easily and it came in one long strip that you have to manually cut. It wasn't hard to cut but it seemed like an easy thing to do. The sides are a bit more flimsy than I was expecting. The paint also seems to scrape off way too easily, especially on the overlapped part so now I wonder if it will rust. For being powder coated I expected a more durable surface. The instructions also say to check every 90 days if the bolts are loose. How will that be possible when it is full of 2ft of dirt? It seems like a locking washer would be a good idea. The tabs on the inside supports are also weird and they also scrape the paint off when installing. The instructions aren't clear on which way is up and the tabs have to be bent into place and then the angle of the corrugated ridges makes for a weird fit.I bought 2 more, we will see over time how they hold up. I am expecting in 3 years I will be spray painting the exterior due to rust.  They are pretty and have a lot of space. They are one of the few raised beds I was able to find that are very deep.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CB5EJRVR2CXE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67","B09SQZJV67","Color: Gray"

I ordered four. The first took about 1.5 hours to build, then each afterward just shy of an hour. I assembled almost entirely by myself; the only part I needed help with was fastening the very-bottom screws.The dimensions are as described. The metal sheets are a bit thin, but once again, it matches the price point. All four came in and delivered undamaged; they were packaged pretty well.Advice for assembling: lay out all items ahead of time. I also used a Kobalt ratcheting screwdriver for tightening down the wing nuts. The maintenance also mentions to retighten over time (impossible, filled with dirt), so I used Loctite as I assembled to make sure the fasteners wouldn't loosen.Keep in mind, this review is after assembly and not after year(s) of continual use.

That said, I still have about 30 minutes of work left.  The trick to easy assembly is to leave all 96 fasteners loose during assembly.

I'm middle aged and fairly in good shape but being hunched over for a long period of time trying to get all 10 screws and nuts in (30 per side) hurt.The corners were bent due to the poor quality of plastic that covered the corners.The metal rails for support in the middle of the beds are super super poor quality and very flimsy so be careful with assembly and bending the metal so much.ProsThe metal is heavy duty.The color is nice.I liked that the outside part that had the plastic protective film to prevent scratching.I like that it came with a rubber protective guard for the top but honestly it isnt needed. The metal does have any sharp edges and isnt thin enough to hurt.If this company has other designs I may try another one out but I wont be getting another one of these just because of how tedious, time consuming, and some of the quality issues I faced.",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RBWmihhnL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RX2GKXPS818/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67","B09SQZJV67","Color: Gray"

With the rising price of wood, we thought that we would go this route and do a metal raised bed, this year.  Other than the 144 bolts and wingnuts, to assemble, the only negatives are the light gauge metals used and the thin paint.  As we assembled the unit, the panels threatened to bend, in the strong breeze, and each time one would brush against another, the paint was left scratched.  Also, the three support braces, across the middle, are very thin aluminum and bent badly before we got the dirt inside.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2023","MeMe","yes","yes","It holds a lot of soil and is a lot sturdier once it's full","I assembled this with my daughter, and it took about 60 minutes from start to finish.  I had to to remove bolts and backtrack a bit because I didn't notice that two corners were upside down -- the holes for the stakes go in the bottom and I didn't even notice that the holes existed in the first place.  A good chunk of the 60 minutes were spent removing the plastic coating from the panels!Anyway, it was fairly easy to build but you will be doing a lot of crouching.  It feels a little wobbly, especially when you are carrying it to the destination, but it feels far more solid once the soil has been added.  Speaking of soil, it takes a LOT to fill this thing up.  I mitigated this somewhat by disassembling the old cedar raised bed which was being replaced and putting the contents of that in the bottom of the new raised bed, but it took four trips to the recycling center to get enough soil to fill it to an acceptable level.I like that it's deep enough to grow carrots in and tall enough to keep rabbits away from green beans.

Only threw in some fallen branches and grass cuttings. It went together really quickly.I wouldn't rest anything heavy on it, like bags of soil. I suspect it will bend it. The cross braces were a different shape entirely than in the instructions. I had to bend them so they would fit. They were easy to bend with my hands which begs the question of how useful they are.I compared the prices of these to a lot of other ones. I wanted a 1.5 to 2 feet of depth. I also tried to compare them to a DIY version. I think I got this for $160 and the DIY in my area would have been $119. I didn't have a truck and no rentals near me so I went with this one. The color is much better looking than a DIY one would look, but the paint scratches super easy. I probably could have painted a DIY one as well.

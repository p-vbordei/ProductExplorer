"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Allan","-","yes","Be careful unboxing and assembling","This item has a lot of sharp metal and pieces. When I received mine it was beat up pretty bad and parts everywhere in the box. They give you a pair of gloves but I didn't see them because they were trapped in between some corner panels. I would strongly recommend using them or Kevlar gloves of your own. Assembly is fairly easy , literally 1/2 a page, and pretty easy to figure out once you get started. It is probably best to assemble close or where you are going to put it. Even though the metal is thin it is pretty sturdy and looks good. I have to wait another 4 weeks before I can start any of my plants outside but this will look nice where I am putting it. This raise bed is a solid buy if you need to contain a garden.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HU8IZ7EJ09CQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRXBH6L2","B0BRXBH6L2","Size: 8x4x2 ft"
"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023","amberamber","yes","-","So far so good.","I just got these March 2023 so I can't speak to longevity. They did arrive with all parts needed and directions. One box appeared to be returned and then sent to me as the bag of parts was cut open and spilled all over. Those panels were the dented ones shown in the photo as well. The dents are at the bottom of the panels so I'm not going to notice them ever again now that they're outside. Disappointing, yes. Enough to send back, no. My 10 year old built both (I bought two 8x4 beds) of these himself and the support bars in the middle kept them very sturdy to carry outside and set up. The metal is covered in a protective film to keep everything from scratching up during delivery and assembly. The one thing I am disappointed in, though I do know it's the way Amazon works, is that I paid $80 for each bed and right after they lowered the price to $66 a piece. I really hate that.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k-vI59ZWL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G17J7V0LVXNP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRXBH6L2","B0BRXB2WKB","Size: 8x4x1 ft"
"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2023","Able","yes","-","Thin gage metal - finish easily scratches","The unit was easily assembled with the supplied hardware. I like that the top edge of the wall panels are hemmed.  Be advised that the metal is very thin and can be easily bent, and the finish is easily scratched so handle with care!  All the pieces come with a plastic film for protection during shipping.  Pealing the film back from the ends of the panels just a couple of inches during the assembly process will help protect the panels until the unit is in its final position. Then remove the film completely as your final set.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R8OKGO6W4UZQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRXBH6L2","B0BRXB2WKB","Size: 8x4x1 ft"

"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2023","JustMyOpinionJustMyOpinion","-","-","Nice Addition To My Raised Beds","I already have 5 other raised beds of different depths and sizes. I generally like having this deeper one but gosh it takes a LOT of soil to fill it so keep that in mind.Assembly was relatively easy though I really dislike having the ""protective"" plastic on it. I think I lost 1/2 hr just peeling it all off, and there were STILL several scratches and dents in the metal anyway. Honestly, this is a GARDEN item. It's going to get scratched and dented over time. Just leave off the plastic in the future please!",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CuPAC9qXL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71kTZE6f8VL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81htAWD0HCL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qBFhEB1uL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R44DJV602F37R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRXBH6L2","B0BRXBH6L2","Size: 8x4x2 ft"
"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023","Maximillian M.","-","-","Easy to Assemble - Appears Sturdy","This will be our first year working with a garden box in our backyard in Washington State. The garden box arrived quickly, and everything was packaged well with simple-to-read assembly instructions. We assembled it in the kitchen and carried it out to the backyard when it was assembled. That made it easier to do on a flat surface. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, and the included gloves were great to protect hands in the process. We kept the protective coating on the panels until after it was assembled and placed outside. This prevented any scratching during assembly. The parts all fit together nicely and now that is in place, I believe that it will last for many years.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HRRTRQN28FCF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRXBH6L2","B0BRXBH6L2","Size: 8x4x2 ft"

"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2022","ReneeSuz","yes","yes","Expected it to be heavier","First off I have to say that one person can't assemble this in 30 minutes (as the instructions state). It took my husband longer even using an electric drill/screwdriver. Be very very careful as the edges are sharp - there are even gloves included to use while assembling.I think it's a bit expensive for what it is - essentially a few pieces of lightweight metal held together at the corners and with a cross beam to try to provide more stability.  I am thankful that I had earned some Amazon gift cards so it didn't feel as expensive.It's not yet installed in our yard as we need to do some digging to secure the planter box but I think it will be a good size for my first year of veggie garden",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1160PIF59Q0P9/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BNPLKNJB","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023","Ole MissOle Miss","yes","yes","Nice Product","I am in the process of getting rid of all my garden containers and putting all my plants in raised gardens.  You can see the old black containers in the background of the image. The picture you see has three raised garden boxes. I didn't know what to get, so I bought a 1 foot, 1 1/2 foot, and 2 foot tall raised garden boxes. All of the boxes are 4 foot by 8 foot in size. The two gray raised garden boxes are the ANLEOLIFE boxes.  The tan garden box in the back was from another company.  The ANLEOLIFE boxes were of much thicker steel than the other companies box.  Now I paid twice as much for the ANLOELIFE boxes, but they seem worth it to me. All the bolts and wing nuts were included, and they were galvanized.  Everything went together nicely. I will have to wait to use them to see which of the two ANLEOLIFE boxes I like the most. The 2 foot tall one requires less bending, but it takes a lot of dirt to fill up. It's also oval shaped, so you loose a little planting space.  The 1 1/2 foot tall model seems to be a happy medium between the shorter and taller garden boxes. It does have center bracing that should help from making the box bow out.  The oval box does not have center bracing.  It's shape probably makes up for it, and I am not worried about it at this time.  I'm hoping to get a few years use out of these boxes.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to getting my garden going.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cIdH4+xFL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R136QNER3B71HW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F","B0BDLC31M4","Size: 8×4×1.5ft Tall | Color: Rectangle-quartz Grey"
"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023","TjitskeTjitske","-","yes","tedious to assemble","This raised garden bed is sturdy once assembled, but it is quite a pain to put together. There are 10 panels that need to be attached, each with 8 screws with a wingnut on the inside. So 80 screws total, which is a lot! That being said, all those screws is what makes is so sturdy, which it needs to be to hold all the dirt and plants you'll be putting in it. Pic shows it partially completed, if you are assembling it by yourself you will probably not want to do it all at once.Cosmetically, it looks nice. I like that it is painted and not just bare metal. It comes in protective packaging, although one of my pieces has some paint scraped off that must've happened at the factory. Fortunately the metal underneath is galvanized, so it still shouldn't rust. I live in an area that gets lots of precipitation, so I will be putting that to the test!",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UAV4esaZL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/918PVfy3jdL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UJSDLTZ4EUO5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F","-","-"

We're getting older so it's nice not to bed over all the time.","I'm a 60 year old lady and it was easy to put together myself.  The top and bottom edge are rolled so there are no sharp edges on the top or the need for a protective cover that will fall apart over time.I added two threaded 1/4"" rods in the center just in case it started to bulge with the weight of the soil.  No one has mentioned this in the reviews but I didn't want to have to empty it to fix the problem.  If you do this you will need a 1/4"" coupling and a ""standard"" screw and washer as the ones that come with it are metric.I placed stumps and thick branches in the bottom then twigs, leaves and grass.  I'll fill the top with soil so it doesn't cost so much fill.Very happy with the product.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/415V+GAZOaL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41kHxAu5ZhL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Te0541YSL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gNUflDnZL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51wD2zEjNgL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-olnpKwqL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M101MYKTAO2F/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F","B0BDLDFCRG","Size: 6×3×2ft Tall | Color: Oval-quartz Grey"

I ran some bailing wire across the center of it to prevent bowing - no supports are included. The approximately 9 million screws that hold it together could stand to be of higher quality, but they do the job. Some are showing signs of rust after a few weeks, but for half the price of competing beds they are a fantastic value. Sheet metal feels sturdy & has a good finish.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX38A1TUCWSZN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F","B0BDLH5M3F","Size: 8×4×2ft Tall | Color: Oval-antique White"

No big deal - just what it is.Great to have instructions clearly written in English vs all pictograms. Do not believe what they say is assembly time. Need to at least double it. I built two and the second one was no faster.Be sure to have area level as that can really throw off how it sits. Unless I missed it, they should detail how much material is required to fill. It is about 1.5 cubic yards. Once filled, walls appear to hold their integrity. This would benefit from coming with rubberized strips for the top rims. I created my own.Beyond that, not much else to add. Seems to be worthwhile purchase.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MT63V1A615YF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F","B0BDLC31M4","Size: 8×4×1.5ft Tall | Color: Rectangle-quartz Grey"

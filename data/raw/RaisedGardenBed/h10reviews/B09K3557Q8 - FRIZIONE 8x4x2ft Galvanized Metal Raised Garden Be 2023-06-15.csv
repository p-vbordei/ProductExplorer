It’s not expensive…just convenient because the hardware included by the manufacturer has been slightly modified so as NOT to fit any standard or metric sockets.  Other than than the planters are easier to assemble with two people.

I bought two. First round: took me three hours. I disregarded other reviews that said only fasten them finger tight. I thought, I don't want to go back and have to fully tighten every single one of them.... I WAS WRONG! DO NOT make this mistake.Also the instructions have you put together the ends first (I bought the 6x3) and I thought hey its 6x3, all the sides will be the same length. NOPE. It comes with 4 side wall pieces and 2 end pieces. They are not labeled.Anyway, I had so many issues with the first round that I almost didn't build the second one. But I thought I might as well because the top soil is coming tomorrow.Second round I build the side walls first, and only tightened them finger tight. Then I added in the cross bars that help support the sides. Then I built the end walls. I stood the side walls upright and put the end wall on top and tightened it finger tight. Then I flipped it and put the other end wall on. It all went together pretty smoothly and only took me about an hour and a half. (I used an electric screw driver the second time around. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT. )I like them both. The first looks a little jacked up. But it'll work. Lesson learned. My third one is coming in a few days.

We started out by buying a couple of the 8x4x2 and one of the 8x4x2, but liked them so much we ordered more. We now have 8 ---- 4 of each size. They were easy to construct and come not only with the needed hardware, but also with stakes to secure them to the ground. We briefly considered making our beds from lumber, but not only would they have been 2-3x more expensive, but living in a wet climate would greatly reduce their life expectancy. Now with these galvanized beds I imagine they will outlive us ;) We also like the fact that we can amend the soil and enhance it from what we would have gotten had we just planted straight into the ground. So we definitely recommend them ---- easy to assemble, long life expectancy, and the ability to enjoy richer, better planting soil.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R156BVXM2AAQHA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09K3557Q8","B09K3557Q8","Size: 8x4x2 FT（1PCS）"

I am looking into ways to help limit the damage but I'm not sure what that looks like yet.This bed, like all projects takes a little bit of time and making sure you read the instructions from start to finish.  One mistake we made, although its not a big deal, was that we put the support sides upside so that the stake holes were on the top and not the bottom.  But, after you fill this bad boy with dirt its not going anywhere anyways.  Also be prepared to spend some time and money filling this thing up.  We filled about the bottom 6 to 8 inches with compost from our yard and rest with top soil and miracle grow.  This is basically a one time investment though and not a big deal.

""Tin"" cuts are even worse than paper cuts.Very well packaged with no possibility of loss or damage.The instructions are brief but the diagrams help and it's not all that difficult to figure out at all.Be prepared for assembly to take a long time - 80 nuts and 80 bolts need to meet each other through either a panel+a bracket or 2 panels+2 brackets.Luckily, the holes are all drilled accurately so the only thing that occasionally makes insertion a little harder is the natural flexibility of the whole construction until you have all the parts connected and supported in place, at which point you get to go round all 80 connection points once more in order to tighten them up.The sharp edges only come into play if you are trying to put this together on your own.  If you have a second person to hold the side panels steady, bolting on a corner piece or joining two panels together would be a whole lot easier on fingers and knuckles.I love that this is 2 feet deep. I have filled the bottom 1ft with rotting firewood left over from Hurricane Sandy, a few fallen and partially decomposed leaves, horse poop and wood chips. Stuff that was just lying around.

The side is in two pieces with very little overlap, and the strength of the reinforcement isn't adequate by itself and there is only two cross braces between the side reinforcements (one at the very bottom and one at the very top).  I will now have to remove a good deal of soil away from sides and beef up the side reinforcements with angle iron and probably put a cable with a turnbuckle between the sides at mid height.

Suggest you level area you want to put it in advance and it does take more soil than I'd imagined.  With grocery prices climbing this unit will pay for itself quickly.  Less expensive then building with wood tho we will probably add wood trim around it to match other landscaping.  I'm only 5' so we set it up so I could walk all around it.

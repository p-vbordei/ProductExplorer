I just started putting them together recently and realized the size is off.  Instead of 8ft long they are only 7.6 ft long, which I'm not happy about.Otherwise, the ease of putting these together is pretty straightforward once you figure it out.  I couldn't find instructions in the box of the first one I was putting together so studied pictures from others who have reviewed.  Of course after putting the first one together and getting rid of the box I discovered the instructions sheet.  It appears to gave been slid into box after packaging so it wasn't visible when I opened the box FLAT on the ground.  There are a TON of screws so this takes time.  I suggest getting them started by hand then firming up with electric drill and rachet/plies to old the bolt.  I also did this by myself but putting sections together inside my garage then joining the larger sections out on my patio and using chairs and trashcan as support.I expect that once completed and filled with soil this will last for many years to come.",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512FaQZzSvL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512dD9vCE+L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A+rGOKZyL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R351F3PRJRZ6KG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC","B09D7QDLYC","Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver"

Most raised beds are only 1' tall, but this one is 2' tall, which makes it suitable for deep root crops like carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and asparagus. The smaller beds were a lighter gauge steel, so they felt kind of flimsy, but the Land Guard bed is very sturdy, and the corners are strong. It is very well designed, and was easy to put together.  When you calculate cost per square foot of the smaller beds (6'x2'x1') compared to the Land Guard bed (8'x4'x2'), the cost per square foot of the Land Guard is about 1/4 the cost of the smaller bed, so you are getting a great value for the price, even though it seems more expensive.  I have bought 3 of them so far, and am considering buying another couple of them.  They are easy to reach without having to do much bending over, which is good for my back.  I fill the bottom (about 1/4 of the way full) with old branches and partially rotted tree trunks because it helps to retain water, and because I don't need to add as much soil (a cost savings).  The wood will break down and release nutrients over the next several years, and I'll only need to top the beds off with some compost to fill them up as the wood shrinks. Overall, it has been a great purchase.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xbONSRdPL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VD7PNZS8R1XX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC","B09D7QDLYC","Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver"

"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2022","Reader X","yes","yes","Flimsy and VERY hard to assemble","I read some reviews that said these boxes were flimsy, but I ordered 2 anyway because they're just going to sit on the ground and hold soil. I expected somewhat floppy sides, but these panels are almost as easy to dent as aluminum foil. That makes them incredibly awkward to assemble because they won't stand up. Also, the 97 screws required to put this nightmare together are very badly machined. As most DIYers know, assembling something with lots of fasteners is much easier if you put in the hardware hand tight first, and then tighten everything once it's together. Impossible with this box. Fully half the screws seize up after only one or two turns, and require tools from there. Also, the instructions are very limited, which was ok until it was time to attach the stabilizing bars. I'm not sure I did it right, and I know longer care. I don't know how I'm going to talk myself into burning another 2 hours to assemble the second one. You get what you pay for. These are cheap and will probably work for what I need, but I won't buy them again.",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRBZA0NVPJBO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC","B09D7QDLYC","Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver"

I was able to put the second unit together much faster after the first.  Imagine approximately 200 nuts and bolts being a screwed on.

Years of debating led me to eventually muster the nerve to place my order, and I'm pleased I did.Galvanized metal is weather resistant and has a long lifespan. The kit is simple to put together. I value its size, which gives me enough room to cultivate a variety of veggies. The location I chose was a little damp and accumulates water when it rains, therefore one of the primary reasons I was searching for a bed with a little more height was for improved drainage.This is a good buy for anyone who is serious about gardening and should take it as a long-term investment, in my opinion.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNDW6J83NB5EQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC","B09D7QDLYC","Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver"

"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","BTWBTW","-","yes","More Growing Room Where Needed","I have a number of garden beds setup since they are conveniently placed near my patio area and allow me to grow various fresh vegetables.  I recently acquired this galvanized bed which is twice as wide as my other beds so I'll be able to grow more tomatoes!The Raised Garden Bed Planter is easy to build using the provided hardware.  A Philips screwdriver and adjustable wrench was needed to tighten up the bolts.  The kit comes with easy-to-follow instructions with everything diagrammed.  The parts that make up the bed are individually marked.The bed comes with three center cross-rods to provide strength.  And each corner is covered by a plastic cap.Once placed in a suitable location the corners can be ""staked"" to the ground using the four supplied corner stakes.  These fit through the galvanized corners and stop the bed from moving around.  Once put together, fill with your favorite mix of growing materials.In my kit I found a pair of gloves as a bonus.The kit itself is very compact when stored.  I look forward to many years of fruitful growing!",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613XJJwsdOL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ColKg-PML.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK63YMZ4BC9J5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BJZ9J4HD","B0BJYX8KV7","Color: Galvanized - 8x4x1ft"

At $86 it's cheaper than others that are about half the size.  Large enough to grow a significant vegetable patch.  For this one I plan to plant okra, 3 rows of 7 plants each.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2023","Hector AlemanHector Aleman","-","-","8 x 4 x 1 inches, raised garden bed galvanized with gloves.","For me this raised garden bed is a great designed method for growing almost every kind of vegetable, herb or fruit that requires soil to thrive. I love the galvanize material because it's easy to assemble and has a high-quality, anti-rust coating that can withstand the weather conditions of our four seasons. This particular raised bed has a strong, rigid designed structure that will not bend or collapse when I fill it with soil because it has 4 full strength stabilizers bars that helps to hold the unit together. Great product that's reasonably priced and can provide me with a lifetime of growing countless vegetables, fruits and herbs and thats truly a thing of beauty.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-JUCxmY7L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SZG4CGWORDVZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BJZ9J4HD","B0BJYX8KV7","Color: Galvanized - 8x4x1ft"

I will say, it would be very difficult to assemble by yourself, you will need a second or third pair of hands.Once assembled, it is easy for one person or two to move around.

I can't speak to it's longevity when exposed to the elements, but from what I can tell, it appears to be well made and easy to assemble. The price point is nice because I have to use raised beds for my vegetable garden and they can be very pricey.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","Chandler","-","-","Works great as a garden or as a pondscape","I bought two ceramic vessels that dribble water down into themselves then pump the water back up to the top on Amazon.  I just wasn't sure how to use them in my gardenscape.This made it perfect!  I put my fountains in the base and filled with river stones.  I planted succulents around the rocks and some trailing rosemary.I just plug in my fountains when we sit on the deck and it sounds like we are sitting by a running stream and it could not be more zen!You can also put them on a timer to come on each night around wine pour time.No need to dig a pond.

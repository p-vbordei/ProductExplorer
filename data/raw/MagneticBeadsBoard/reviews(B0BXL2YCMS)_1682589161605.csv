Constructive, safe play for the littles.","First, all the little parts are contained inside the Board. Board is sealed. The stylus is 4 inches long and .4 inches diameter and blunt. The stylus and the cards meant to be copied are the only loose parts.The idea is you take one of the many included cards, place in front of you (a slot exists for this purpose at the top), and you pick up colored metal dots with the magnet end of the stylus through the clear plexi and pull away at the right place to drop them.Duplicating the pattern takes a bit of focus, and picking/dropping the dots requires some eye-hand coordination. Perfect for the littles, and sort of oddly engaging for older kids/parents/grandparents.Two cons and they are weak:1) After storage or shaking inverted, the dots can get double-stacked in the selection tray. No biggie, but get them sorted (a little shaking in the right orientation) before handing it over. Or enjoy the frustration when little Thurston gets to the end and shaking the last two pieces to un-stack wrecks his progress.2) Someday, soon, the cards and the board will not be at the same place. I will be attaching (maybe stick-on hook and loop) a re-sealable food bag to the back to store the cards. The board should come with something that does this. Because kids.I like this. It seems engaging and yet mostly child-proof. The sweet spot.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J4PI4jBKL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81H5iDZWstL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Vhv9Ya2CL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

This looked like a great new activity for trips in the car, and both my daughters are having a blast using it. The included cards with ideas to replicate on the board are really fun, although I wish there was a place to store them on the back!! But being able to stand them up in front is great. It's really fun and easy to use, and feels like decent quality materials. The clear plastic front was already getting scuffed from use on the first day, which is a little disappointing, but doesn't bother my kids or interfere with its use. I love that there's no way to lose any of the pieces, and it's encouraging kids to be creative and get away from screens.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717fY-3X3iL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816z00WbgOL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81A-nxg5TXL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

All the pieces are the right way (I've had some that were turned around and it was obvious). They do look like candy so be mindful that it doesn't break and children try to eat the magnets. Bad news. Otherwise I like that it has a tie on the pen. It's easy to move the pieces, just make sure the pen is straight up and down. The only thing that is a bummer is that there's no where to store the cards. I would think some built-in clips or a pocket to hold them onto the back of the board would have made sense. There's room for that. Alas, they'll most likely get lost. Bummer that it wasn't thought of in designing.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q1q0MFETL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aJvK6FQML._SL1600_.jpg""]"

I have tried a couple that haven't functioned as they should. This is a better quality construction than some of the others out there. The magnets are about the same diameter as an M&M, but not only about half as thick. The magnetic wand works great to grab them, and the plastic cover is sturdy, but still thin enough to allow you to move them freely. This is a winner in my book. I will be keeping this around for the grandkids. Great for travel because it's all contained (except for the cards) and the wand is attached. Great toddler toy.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lxvUkyxKL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

I thought at first, too many beads to loose, not getting it. Well, the magnetic beads are completely contained behind plastic.Your child would have to damage the toy to get them out. You use the magnetic wand to grab the colored beads to make a pattern or your own drawing. It is easy. This would be great for improving motor skills, learning colors, following a pattern, all with no electronics involved. I even enjoyed trying it!

The large magnetic board and colorful magnetic dots provide endless opportunities for creativity and imaginative play.I appreciate that this toy also has educational value, as it encourages fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It's also a great way for kids to practice drawing and writing without wasting paper.The board is well-made and durable, and the magnetic dots are strong enough to stay in place but easy enough for little hands to manipulate. It's also easy to wipe clean when playtime is over.Overall, I highly recommend the Cheffun Magnetic Drawing Doodle Board for Kids as a fun and educational toy for kids of all ages.

The examples are easy for an adult to follow, but there is a lot of counting and space management, enough to keep a child quite engaged. The toy is nicely designed with things like a space to stand up the pattern as you're following it, and the pen is attached. All the magnets are behind plastic, so there is no mess or fear of pieces getting lost. I would love it if there was a pouch on the back for the patterns, but I have put them in a bag and so far nothing has happened to them; we just keep the bag and the board together.This would be a great toy for a car trip, quiet time, or any time a child could use something to do that is creative, a little challenging, quiet, and easy to clean up!",false,"[]"

Mitchell",5,"Improvement on an old classic","I really like this toy.Here's what my hubby said about this product after playing with it. ""What a great idea!A drawing board with no mess and no parts to lose!Kids will have a great time recreating the included patterns or creating their own masterpiece.Hours of fun for sure.Great for car rides too.No more ""are we there yet""!This is a sanity saver for parents!He also said that it looks like chocolate candies inside the board so it may even cause some chocolate cravings!It reminds me of the old light bright game that I loved as a kid. The only problem is that you lose the little pegs and the vacuum would eat them. This really is an improvement on it. You don't have to purchase more of the black papers to put into the machine. It's self contained.It's such a great gift for a creative child who loves to draw, but their drawing surface sometimes includes the walls of the house! Been there too many times.I like that it also is fun for adults. Kind of like those coloring books for adults.The plastic is good quality. I worry about the surface getting scratched up over time. it would be great if there was a 'screen protector' that you could just pull off when it gets scratched and throw on a new one.There will be many hours of fun from this creative toy. And the bonus that I really like is that there's nothing electronic about it!

My biggest plus is that the pen has a leash! No more lost pens! I also like that this board is larger so there is more space for free play design. At first I didn't know if I liked that the cards just sits on top, however, my 5 year old liked the challenge of having to look at the card and counting to figure out where to put the dots. My kids prefer the picture cards with this board over the other ones we have. The subjects are easy to see, cute, and child friendly. My only complaint is that there is not place to store the cards on the board. It just would be nice if it could be all kept together. Other than that, I am very pleased with this toy!",false,"[]"

Still use only under adult supervision due to the potential for the case to break.- 5 colors makes this simple for little kids.- the case is fun!- lots of designs to copy- a slot for the card to stand in while you copy the design- slot to keep the magnet pen.- relaxing activity!- easy to use! The pen holds the magnet pieces and drags them into place easily.What I don't love:- the quality of the sealed compartment is lacking. The sheet is already scratched after only a few days. It feels loose, like you can move it around, and press on the sheet and it dips in. For a toy with magnets, advertised for 3+, a high quality sealed compartment should have been a priority. I think it's a thin plastic sheet like you'd expect on a dollar store toy? It should have been something significantly stronger.Overall, the quality makes me feel like this should be a $10 ($15 tops) toy, for which I'd recommend. 2 stars off for quality, since I'll most likely toss this once the sheet is broken and at $20 that feels like a very bad price (not to mention bad for the environment).I love everything else about this, though! If the quality of materials were improved this would easily be 5 stars because it's a fun activity! I even like using it myself, to be honest.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AxXdd3hCL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71FfyODXX9L._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Isn't that great. The magnet pen doesn't have any attachment string like many other devices do. The cards reek of chemical smell. The front plastic is thin and flimsy, not thicker material like they used to have. It also scratches very easily. Some of the discs were not smoothly shaved, leaving rough edges which makes some hard to set. The indents are very deep, so it's harder to get the pieces to stay put. And the amount of colored discs are unbalanced. Also, the small size uses the same casing as the bigger one, but holds much fewer pieces than what would actually fit.It would be fun for some kids, but with a more limited number of variable colors and a very limited quantity of each, some much more than others, It only hampers some creativity and therefore has a decreased replay value.It is a horrible, but it isn't great either. It could be so much better with a few quality improvements on manufacturing and materials.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619jcWo8XGL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

The magnetic pen is stored in a little opening in the front. It's easy to put in and take out. It comes with 14 designs, 2 on each of the 7 cards, to mimic. Once the pen is removed, a card can be placed in the small opening for the card to stand up. It's best to slightly put it in. Otherwise pushing the card all the way down will cause it to tilt a little.The drawing board has a clear covering with visibility to the colorful magnets. The magnets looks like a popular candy. It's easy to move the magnets into the empty circles to make the design on one of the card designs or to make ones own design.Titling the board down removes the magnets from the circular spaces.Since it's a kids toy, laminated cards would be helpful. It would also be nice if there were more cards; perhaps to include the alphabet or numbers or shapes.This would be a really fun concept for a multipack for adults to compete against eachother; even for team building.I certainly recommend the magnetic drawing board.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61D9Ou29KZL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Okay so first, you don't really draw with the HINSLEAMER 10.3‚Äù Magnetic Drawing Board. It comes with a magnetic pen that you'll pull the small colorful pieces into the placement rack. This in itself takes a bit of focus and time. Something that most toddlers and kids lack. Second, there are some design guides you can follow and create a completed image but those designs aren't very interesting (at least in my opinion). In terms of design though, the HINSLEAMER 10.3‚Äù Magnetic Drawing Board comes with a slot for the magnetic pen along with a mount for the design guides. That being said, the HINSLEAMER 10.3‚Äù Magnetic Drawing Board hasn't quite drawn the attention from my toddler as some other toys but only time will tell.

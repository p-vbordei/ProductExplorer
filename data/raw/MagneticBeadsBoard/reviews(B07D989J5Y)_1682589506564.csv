Most everything that is advertised as writes in the shower/rain is too small, disposable, or doesn't work with water or humidity. It wasn't until remembering this toy from my childhood that I found something that works. It isn't perfect but good enough to write down some key words and revisit after the shower. As for it's quality, it is pretty much the same as all those years ago; which is also just good enough. The drawings always had a bit of blurriness to them. The ""pen"" doesn't write fine lines. And, it could erase better. But, all in all, it is doing what I need it to do and I'd imagine the kids wouldn't mind the downsides. So still a good gift/toy at a price that seems reasonable in todays market.",false,"[]"

It came today and of course he loves it, he's 2, but I was very disappointed. It is very cheap plastic that is likely to break if he happens to throw it during a 'terrible two tantrum', and it's very hard to slide the eraser slider- he literally can't unless I help him. The screen is super sensitive to touch, also. A finger can write on it, no need for the magnetic pen....which kind of defeats the purpose.I will say though, I do blame myself for ordering without paying closer attention to the brand of it, as I have always been disappointed with Crazy Art merchandise that I have purchased in the past. Lesson finally learned on my part.I will just keep it instead of the hassle of returning it, only because my son does love the concept. But, it is definitely disappointing.

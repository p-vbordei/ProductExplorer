My youngest received this is a Christmas present and he is obsessed with it. We take the smaller one in the car for him to play with. It is pretty durable as well as he has thrown them multiple times and they have eat to break or even crack. This is great for children of all ages as my 10 year old even gets entertainment out of it. So if your looking for something fun that provides a little color behind the sketch than this is the toy for you!-one satisfied mommy.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IefEVvLuL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

I bought this for my 3 year old niece who was coming to stay with me for a few days from out-of-state while her parents took a trip with friends. I bought this the day before she arrived & as promised, it was delivered the very next day (for free too). My niece LOVED both of the magnadoodle things that came together! She really had a fun time with the magnets that are shapes. Ha the moment she started she asked how we were going to save all her pieces of art, so to appease her I took a pic of every single creation lol. She enjoyed this thing every day she visited & was so bummed she couldn‚Äôt take it home with her‚Ä¶.until I showed her the travel sized one she could have! Ha boy was she excited about that. Her father (my brother) told me she‚Äôs played with extremely cheap ones before, but she never enjoyed them because they broke instantly & didn‚Äôt work right. He told me those were like $0.99 each though, so I‚Äôm not surprised. While it obviously is not recommended, I watched (& corrected) my niece slam the magnets or pen into the screen a good few times (while I cringed), yet each time it held up with zero damage. That was a pleasant surprise. I was originally torn between an old fashioned etcha sketch or one of these, but I was sold on the multi-colors aspect of this one. I highly recommend this item if you‚Äôre looking for some good ole non-electronic entertainment for young ones. Actually, I remember enjoying my etcha sketch until I was pretty old ha. This company is great to deal with as well. They offered 6 free stickers if I contacted on Facebook (the item came with one of the stickers & myself & the niece loved it, so I had to get the additional 6). I contacted them to see if they could mail them to my nieces address instead of mine & they had no problem with it. Thanks again to them for that & these sweet magnadoodles!!!! :)",false,"[]"

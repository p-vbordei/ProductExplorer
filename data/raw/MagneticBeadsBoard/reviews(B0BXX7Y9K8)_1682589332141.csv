I don't feel the colors are very bright (the picture I took shows it off better than it actually is), and I did feel like the box implied that it would have more colors than it does. The box also suggests that if a child jumped on it, it would be just fine. I highly doubt that. I'm not gonna have a kid try it, but it's a flimsy plastic board. It's not meant to endure a human jumping on it. Anyway, my kids are enjoying it, it gets pulled out regularly, so good enough. I just wish the advertising was more up front.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71loXZWhxFL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Mair",5,"Great Fun for Kids","I wish I could estimate how many sheets of paper this has already saved. I ordered some of these to have on hand not knowing if the kids would like them but they were such a hit I ordered another one to have one for all of them. All of the kids in my family LOVE this toy. It's easy to use and allows them to draw over and over again. The size is manageable for even the youngest and they erase fairly well even after multiple uses. The only complaint the kids have about them is they can't control the colors and they can't keep what they draw after they're done if they want to use it again. Most of the time though, their desire to draw more eventually outweighs their concerns fairly quickly. This is also reasonably tough and has withstood being dropped a few times by overeager kids. It's reasonably priced and I would recommend one for every kid who loves to draw A LOT. You'll save a crazy amount of paper.",false,"[]"

Pederson",4,"Great for kids!","The media could not be loaded.¬†Hey, this is fun! Reminds this 62 yr old of an Etch-a-Sketch without the frustration and more freedom! This tablet came well-packaged in an appropriate-size box from Amazon. The product is in new condition. READY TO USE right out of the box, it comes with the CR2032 3V battery already installed. A stylus is attached at the top to prevent losing it. (You need the stylus, fingers don‚Äôt work!). When you draw on it, the text or lines of drawing are MULTI-COLORED for a fun twist. The tablet is very LIGHTWEIGHT with plastic of your color choice around the screen. It‚Äôs well-constructed but probably wouldn‚Äôt stand up to a lot of rough play or drops. It comes with a cord to connect the stylus to the unit, a writing and drawing ‚Äúcopy‚Äù book your child can use to learn how to draw and write, a contact and thank-you card. Instructions come in English and other languages, though there‚Äôs not much to learn. I would have given the product 5 stars except that the Erase Button (which you can lock!) can only erase EVERYTHING on the screen, not just the last line drawn which is disappointing. I think my nieces, age 6 & 8 will enjoy these.

There is a stylus attached by a lanyard so no risk of losing it but any hard object can be used to write on pad.Included coin battery is protected by screw retained cover for safety. I'm thinking of getting one for myself to use instead of scratch paper or post it notes. No radiation to the eyes to worry about, and accidental dropping is not as catastrophic as dropping an iPad. Educational value is only limited by the child's imagination.Learning math, cursive writing, times table, etc.I can see this being used in a kindergarten classroom. I think this pad is a better alternative than a dry erase board because you don't have to replace the marker.",false,"[]"

Technically, it is an LCD, but not necessarily what you think. LCD means liquid-crystal display. The colors that you see in this tablet have nothing to do with LCD. They are just a fixed background that you get to see once the black LCD is ""erased"" with the stylus. Also, the colors are not as bright as they are depicted in the product page. So, this product is like Magna Doddle but its black-white counterpart with a colorful background and a battery-powered ""erase all"" button.

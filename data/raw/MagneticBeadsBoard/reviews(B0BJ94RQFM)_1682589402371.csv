Chandler",5,"Perfect Gift for Younger Grandkid","My granddaughter loves this doodle toy. She is three and knew immediately how to use the magnetic pen and erase the screen. Unlike other magnetic boards, this one provides multiple learning games in addition to drawing: shapes, colors, puzzles, and more. The 7 in 1 activity board design means toddlers will enjoy for several years. A mesh storage bag is included for the beads and string. Recommended for hours of fun.",false,"[]"

The writing on it shows up quite a bit lighter than other boards, so its more difficult to see whats being drawn. Especially with the yellow section its much less readable. The magnets shapes work well along with the pen aside from the light readability on the magnetic board.The beads on a string don’t really match well with the picture since you can only stack the beads on top of each other and the beads on a sting picture shows a side profile, which confused my son. I would suggest looking for a different magnetic board that is much more readable.",false,"[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Zsj768EuL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gsnZLWU7L._SL1600_.jpg""]"

"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2022",Mark T. SkeenMark T. Skeen,yes,yes,unexpectedly impressed for a good value.,"We researched materials for our raised beds for a very long time.  My wife had a vision for her vegetable garden and was incredibly disappointed when we finally decided her first choice material of cedar was going to be just too expensive.  We thought galvanized would be our next option but she really didn't want the look of the steel so we opted for the black.  We saved (literally)hundreds by going with these black galvanized beds and we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed with the entire experience.  While waiting for the order we spent a lot of time watching youtube videos about ""mistakes"" and the ""hassles"" of putting together galvanized beds, and honestly, made ourselves anxious for no reason.Putting these beds tother IS time-consuming but NOT hard.  The larger 4X8 beds are easier with two people (just because of the number of screws and bolts you have to use and lining up the longer side pieces) but my wife actually did the 4X4 beds herself in under an hour each.So don't let the videos or other negative experiences scare you off.  That said here are some tips I'd advise:Most importantly- the flatter your surface the better the beds are going to sit and look. We did a lot of leveling before placing the beds and you can clearly see where we did a better job than not.  (I would also advise putting these beds together on a flat hard surface such as a patio, driveway, etc, then placing them where you want. It just makes lining up the pieces SO much easier)Here's what I learned from other reviewer's experiences that are worth paying attention to:  the reviewer ""runtails"" gave great advice in saying ""it is important although not immediately obvious, that the four corner pieces are oriented so the holes for the stability poles are all down"" and I would not have even noticed that had I not read that review first (and probably would have ended up having to take apart and put back together pieces)I also read a few reviews talking about receiving damaged products or the material ""scratching"" easily. Fortunately, we received all 4 of our beds in perfect condition and because I had read about the scratching, we were very careful in handling the pieces so they didn't scratch. We even kept the plastic coating lining the pieces until they were assembled and placed and I think this helped.We purchase 4 beds for about what it was going to cost us to build 2 cedar beds and I am thrilled with how it turned out.  Not only would I not hesitate to recommend these beds, but we'll also be ordering more beds next season to add.  They work well and are esthetically beautiful and I can't wait to get the paths mulched and the area fenced in.  As my wife noted, ""this is going to look even better than I envisioned!""",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51FlJwWyn8L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TCHkwzgNL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UYSefW9SL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YnxYS3YNL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JKRKNJZKLS3L/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67,B09SQZJV67,Color: Gray
"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2022",Timothy FountainTimothy Fountain,yes,yes,Very flimsy,"The product is nice and light weight but the packaging was a minimal most every corner was bent. I had to bend back and damage them to be able to assemble. The metal pieces are all plastic covered to avoid damage (awesome) which seems great but as soon as it is removed the surface will scratch VERY easily. I will probably have to paint. I expected more for the cost.Update: One year after install there are several sections with significant rust creating holes on the sides.  I am going to paint with a rust protector in hopes of extending the life of the raised garden, but after only one year this might be a bust.",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oPn4bH3KL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xfM2ViliL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71diHXJm+kL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JIIDUD9LHKRW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67,B09SQZJV67,Color: Gray
"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022",Angela,yes,yes,Pretty good with some caveats,"We just put 4 of these raised garden beds together over the weekend.Pros: easy to move, fairly easy to put together with 1 person. Looks niceCons: Instructions don't call out that the hole needs to be at the bottom for the stakes. The rubber top seems like it will come off easily and it came in one long strip that you have to manually cut. It wasn't hard to cut but it seemed like an easy thing to do. The sides are a bit more flimsy than I was expecting. The paint also seems to scrape off way too easily, especially on the overlapped part so now I wonder if it will rust. For being powder coated I expected a more durable surface. The instructions also say to check every 90 days if the bolts are loose. How will that be possible when it is full of 2ft of dirt? It seems like a locking washer would be a good idea. The tabs on the inside supports are also weird and they also scrape the paint off when installing. The instructions aren't clear on which way is up and the tabs have to be bent into place and then the angle of the corrugated ridges makes for a weird fit.I bought 2 more, we will see over time how they hold up. I am expecting in 3 years I will be spray painting the exterior due to rust.  They are pretty and have a lot of space. They are one of the few raised beds I was able to find that are very deep.",4,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CB5EJRVR2CXE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67,B09SQZJV67,Color: Gray

"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023",Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,yes,yes,Time Consuming but Matched the Price,"For $150, you essentially get what you pay for.I did LOTS of shopping around and finally landed on this item. I ordered four. The first took about 1.5 hours to build, then each afterward just shy of an hour. I assembled almost entirely by myself; the only part I needed help with was fastening the very-bottom screws.The dimensions are as described. The metal sheets are a bit thin, but once again, it matches the price point. All four came in and delivered undamaged; they were packaged pretty well.Advice for assembling: lay out all items ahead of time. I also used a Kobalt ratcheting screwdriver for tightening down the wing nuts. The maintenance also mentions to retighten over time (impossible, filled with dirt), so I used Loctite as I assembled to make sure the fasteners wouldn't loosen.Keep in mind, this review is after assembly and not after year(s) of continual use. I will update my review if I feel the beds don't stand up to typical use.",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Uvz7MAMKL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91qpgBpV06L.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QD499YTY0M2B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67,B09SQZJV67,Color: Gray
"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2023",Art WellingArt Welling,yes,yes,Leave everything loose till it's all together,"I'm a banged-up old retired instructor, and it still only took about an hour to assemble by myself.  That said, I still have about 30 minutes of work left.  The trick to easy assembly is to leave all 96 fasteners loose during assembly.  This makes lining up the holes a breeze.The next task, after tightening everything, will be scraping up 128 cubic feet of yard waste and bio-mass to fill the bed.  I'll top it with 4""-5"" of garden soil.The bed feels lightweight and flimsy, but clearly, once it's filled it will be a very solid mass.

We did not find any notices of toxic materials used for food items used listed in this article or descrption.  There was a tiny sticker on one of the panels that mentioned a cancer warning and reproductive harm after you open the carton.

These are nearly impossible to ""Not Scatch""  The coating is super thin and scratch easily.Also, take note that the seller makes you pay postage to return - which I found disqusting.

"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022",melmel,yes,yes,It's an okay garden bed,"I have 5 other garden beds aside from this one from a different company. I purchased one of these before I bought more so this is garden bed number 6.These are my pros and cons.ConsThis was the most time consuming and tedious garden bed I've put together. I'm middle aged and fairly in good shape but being hunched over for a long period of time trying to get all 10 screws and nuts in (30 per side) hurt.The corners were bent due to the poor quality of plastic that covered the corners.The metal rails for support in the middle of the beds are super super poor quality and very flimsy so be careful with assembly and bending the metal so much.ProsThe metal is heavy duty.The color is nice.I liked that the outside part that had the plastic protective film to prevent scratching.I like that it came with a rubber protective guard for the top but honestly it isnt needed. The metal does have any sharp edges and isnt thin enough to hurt.If this company has other designs I may try another one out but I wont be getting another one of these just because of how tedious, time consuming, and some of the quality issues I faced.",3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RBWmihhnL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RX2GKXPS818/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09SQZJV67,B09SQZJV67,Color: Gray

"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022",L. Maffett,yes,yes,"Nice size, but sort of lightweight.","I will say that it looks good in our yard.  With the rising price of wood, we thought that we would go this route and do a metal raised bed, this year.  Other than the 144 bolts and wingnuts, to assemble, the only negatives are the light gauge metals used and the thin paint.  As we assembled the unit, the panels threatened to bend, in the strong breeze, and each time one would brush against another, the paint was left scratched.  Also, the three support braces, across the middle, are very thin aluminum and bent badly before we got the dirt inside.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2022",Brandon B.Brandon B.,yes,yes,Cheap and flimsy,"We were trying to replace old rotted wooden boxes  so we figured we'd try these metal ones.First, it took forever to put together. So many little screws and wing nuts, with almost no good way to hold it together during the process.Secondly, and more importantly, it is flimsy and cheap. The middle supports were bending just as we were maneuvering it empty. Then, when we began to fill it they all bent and are completely shot.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2023",MeMe,yes,yes,It holds a lot of soil and is a lot sturdier once it's full,"I assembled this with my daughter, and it took about 60 minutes from start to finish.  I had to to remove bolts and backtrack a bit because I didn't notice that two corners were upside down -- the holes for the stakes go in the bottom and I didn't even notice that the holes existed in the first place.  A good chunk of the 60 minutes were spent removing the plastic coating from the panels!Anyway, it was fairly easy to build but you will be doing a lot of crouching.  It feels a little wobbly, especially when you are carrying it to the destination, but it feels far more solid once the soil has been added.  Speaking of soil, it takes a LOT to fill this thing up.  I mitigated this somewhat by disassembling the old cedar raised bed which was being replaced and putting the contents of that in the bottom of the new raised bed, but it took four trips to the recycling center to get enough soil to fill it to an acceptable level.I like that it's deep enough to grow carrots in and tall enough to keep rabbits away from green beans.

The cross braces were a different shape entirely than in the instructions. I had to bend them so they would fit. They were easy to bend with my hands which begs the question of how useful they are.I compared the prices of these to a lot of other ones. I wanted a 1.5 to 2 feet of depth. I also tried to compare them to a DIY version. I think I got this for $160 and the DIY in my area would have been $119. I didn't have a truck and no rentals near me so I went with this one. The color is much better looking than a DIY one would look, but the paint scratches super easy. I probably could have painted a DIY one as well.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023",Ole MissOle Miss,yes,yes,Nice Product,"I am in the process of getting rid of all my garden containers and putting all my plants in raised gardens.  You can see the old black containers in the background of the image. The picture you see has three raised garden boxes. I didn't know what to get, so I bought a 1 foot, 1 1/2 foot, and 2 foot tall raised garden boxes. All of the boxes are 4 foot by 8 foot in size. The two gray raised garden boxes are the ANLEOLIFE boxes.  The tan garden box in the back was from another company.  The ANLEOLIFE boxes were of much thicker steel than the other companies box.  Now I paid twice as much for the ANLOELIFE boxes, but they seem worth it to me. All the bolts and wing nuts were included, and they were galvanized.  Everything went together nicely. I will have to wait to use them to see which of the two ANLEOLIFE boxes I like the most. The 2 foot tall one requires less bending, but it takes a lot of dirt to fill up. It's also oval shaped, so you loose a little planting space.  The 1 1/2 foot tall model seems to be a happy medium between the shorter and taller garden boxes. It does have center bracing that should help from making the box bow out.  The oval box does not have center bracing.  It's shape probably makes up for it, and I am not worried about it at this time.  I'm hoping to get a few years use out of these boxes.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to getting my garden going.",5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41cIdH4+xFL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R136QNER3B71HW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BDLH5M3F,B0BDLC31M4,Size: 8×4×1.5ft Tall | Color: Rectangle-quartz Grey

There are 10 panels that need to be attached, each with 8 screws with a wingnut on the inside. So 80 screws total, which is a lot! That being said, all those screws is what makes is so sturdy, which it needs to be to hold all the dirt and plants you'll be putting in it. Pic shows it partially completed, if you are assembling it by yourself you will probably not want to do it all at once.Cosmetically, it looks nice. I like that it is painted and not just bare metal. It comes in protective packaging, although one of my pieces has some paint scraped off that must've happened at the factory. Fortunately the metal underneath is galvanized, so it still shouldn't rust.

I thought, I don't want to go back and have to fully tighten every single one of them.... I WAS WRONG! DO NOT make this mistake.Also the instructions have you put together the ends first (I bought the 6x3) and I thought hey its 6x3, all the sides will be the same length. NOPE. It comes with 4 side wall pieces and 2 end pieces. They are not labeled.Anyway, I had so many issues with the first round that I almost didn't build the second one. But I thought I might as well because the top soil is coming tomorrow.Second round I build the side walls first, and only tightened them finger tight. Then I added in the cross bars that help support the sides. Then I built the end walls. I stood the side walls upright and put the end wall on top and tightened it finger tight. Then I flipped it and put the other end wall on. It all went together pretty smoothly and only took me about an hour and a half. (I used an electric screw driver the second time around. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT. )I like them both. The first looks a little jacked up. But it'll work. Lesson learned. My third one is coming in a few days.

That's a lot! I am on blood thinner and had to be VERY careful not to cut myself when assembling this. BTW that took me almost two hours - I kept dropping the small bolts or nuts and had to find where they had rolled.  The box and pacing are neatly designed, but I am sure some prefab work could have been done by manufacturer to shorten the assembly time for the purchaser. This unit does have a rolled upper edge which is better for safety, but the connector plates are like razors. My grandson bumped into a corner edge and it punctured and deeply cut his leg. If it had been me, that could have been a disaster. I am trying to figure out something that will cover all the sharp edges and prevent future cuts.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2022",paulicious21,yes,-,Really bad quality control.,"The only good thing about this is that it holds dirt. Assembly is awful. As other reviewers have pointed out the screws just aren't long enough. They work but it takes awhile for them to grab. Also it bulges at the joints on the long side. Not very attractive looking. We bought two of these and noticed they don't have the same dimensions. I haven't measured yet but looking at them side by side it's very obvious. I was also not impressed with shipping. I bought both of them the same day and one was a few days late. There is no reason that should have happened, other than their choice of shipping with the post office. I wouldn't buy this again.

Hubby put this together with very little cursing.  The unit is light so easy to move around tho easier to do so with 2 people because of size.  Suggest you level area you want to put it in advance and it does take more soil than I'd imagined.  With grocery prices climbing this unit will pay for itself quickly.  Less expensive then building with wood tho we will probably add wood trim around it to match other landscaping.  I'm only 5' so we set it up so I could walk all around it.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023",Tightwad in KC,yes,yes,Good solution for raised bed,"We needed a solution for the front of our house. There is a short retaining wall along the sidewalk that runs across the front of our house. A raised bed would be easy to plant and maintain, and would  plan allow the plantings to be easier to see as they would be two feet higher than the ground.  The 4ft wide by 8ft long (2 feet high) looks to be ideal.The box included ten section which were easy to put together, two straight panels on each side and three curves for each end. I would recommend you use an electric drill or impact driver rather than a standard screw driver or the little screw driver that came with it. Because of the shape of the horizontal ridges, you do not need a wrench to hold the nut. Using your fingers to hold the nut while running an impact driver was the best approach.The holes for each panel are drilled with precision so there was not wrestling to get all the screws and nuts in place. And while the edges of the panels are sharp, the top and bottom edges (the parts you grab with you hands when putting in place) have rounded edges. For safety's sake, the box included gloves which you could use when unpacking or carrying. I did not use them.Next step will be filling the raised bed with organic material, top soil and them plants. Looks to be an ideal solution and well made.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OBVTA8KY6M1E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ,B0BG2HP1PJ,Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）

"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",Andrew,-,-,A great purchase when on sale,"First, I want to say that I got this for 119$. I find this to be a fair price for a bed of this size. I would not buy it for 175$ or whatever price that is higher than 119$. Why? Because for a few bucks more, I could get a 32 inch version that has paint protecting. These are bare metal which I do assume will last quite a few years, I hardly expect to last longer than the aforementioned.That being said. This bed is great. It's very thick and heavy steel. You can treat it yourself if you're worried about rust which will cost extra money but give you the same results as one that is already painted.The only reason I took stars off is due to that reason and the price without coupon. If I were going to consider this at full price, I would just go one step better and grab the painted ones.This also does not come with rubber edging which in my opinion, is needed. These get very hot in the summer to the touch also again, because it's not painted.So, do I recommend these? That is a resounding yes IF you get them for around 119$. Otherwise, I would not recommend them for the reasons already mentioned. 24 inches is a pretty perfect height for gardening and should keep a lot of unwanted animals out.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IS0TDFVYV8XQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ,B0BG2HP1PJ,Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）

I would strongly recommend using them or Kevlar gloves of your own. Assembly is fairly easy , literally 1/2 a page, and pretty easy to figure out once you get started. It is probably best to assemble close or where you are going to put it. Even though the metal is thin it is pretty sturdy and looks good.

My 10 year old built both (I bought two 8x4 beds) of these himself and the support bars in the middle kept them very sturdy to carry outside and set up. The metal is covered in a protective film to keep everything from scratching up during delivery and assembly.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2023",Brandon N.,yes,-,Its not 8x4x2,"So to start this whole thing took over a month but in the end I will say the company did make it right.I am however writing this review to warm people who may be fooled how I was. The listing says the bed is 8x4x2 after that it then says its 22"" the bed is not 24"" tall as advertised and I was informed by the company this is to ""make it easier for customers to find"" That is bologna. The bed is not 2 ft tall and if you are putting it in a garden full of 2ft tall beds it is very noticeable. As an attempt to fix this issue I was sent out another bed. The second bed of course was also not 2ft tall but it also had paint issues and rust when I opened the box. I ended up throwing the bed away as I live in south Florida and the sun and humidity is not kind to anything.That being said after over a month of back and forth I was given back my money.Now here is the hard part. The one bed I do have is amazing. The build quality the strength everything. Its one of my favorite beds in my entire garden, but lying about its size and then sending me a rusty bubbled bed was sadly enough for me to look elsewhere for my raised beds.If you are looking for raised beds and do not care if they are 24"" tall then these are an incredible option I really wish it was the right height. I will say though check your beds when you get them, you may also get one with bubbling paint and starting to rust and for me its unacceptable for something that is supposed to live its entire life outside. As long as the height doesn't matter to you and you are conscious that it may have some manufacturer defect I would recommend these beds. They are well built easy to assemble and sturdy as all get out once built and filled.

"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2023",Kindle CustomerKindle Customer,yes,yes,Durable choice for raised bed,"I am very pleased with this bed.  Most raised beds are only 1' tall, but this one is 2' tall, which makes it suitable for deep root crops like carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and asparagus. The smaller beds were a lighter gauge steel, so they felt kind of flimsy, but the Land Guard bed is very sturdy, and the corners are strong. It is very well designed, and was easy to put together.  When you calculate cost per square foot of the smaller beds (6'x2'x1') compared to the Land Guard bed (8'x4'x2'), the cost per square foot of the Land Guard is about 1/4 the cost of the smaller bed, so you are getting a great value for the price, even though it seems more expensive.  I have bought 3 of them so far, and am considering buying another couple of them.  They are easy to reach without having to do much bending over, which is good for my back.  I fill the bottom (about 1/4 of the way full) with old branches and partially rotted tree trunks because it helps to retain water, and because I don't need to add as much soil (a cost savings).  The wood will break down and release nutrients over the next several years, and I'll only need to top the beds off with some compost to fill them up as the wood shrinks. Overall, it has been a great purchase.",5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xbONSRdPL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VD7PNZS8R1XX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC,B09D7QDLYC,Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver

"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2022",Reader X,yes,yes,Flimsy and VERY hard to assemble,"I read some reviews that said these boxes were flimsy, but I ordered 2 anyway because they're just going to sit on the ground and hold soil. I expected somewhat floppy sides, but these panels are almost as easy to dent as aluminum foil. That makes them incredibly awkward to assemble because they won't stand up. Also, the 97 screws required to put this nightmare together are very badly machined. As most DIYers know, assembling something with lots of fasteners is much easier if you put in the hardware hand tight first, and then tighten everything once it's together. Impossible with this box. Fully half the screws seize up after only one or two turns, and require tools from there. Also, the instructions are very limited, which was ok until it was time to attach the stabilizing bars. I'm not sure I did it right, and I know longer care. I don't know how I'm going to talk myself into burning another 2 hours to assemble the second one. You get what you pay for. These are cheap and will probably work for what I need, but I won't buy them again.",2,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRBZA0NVPJBO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09D7QDLYC,B09D7QDLYC,Size: 8×4×2ft | Color: 1-silver

When I was using the shovel I slammed it down on the edge and it bent it pretty good so you need to be careful when using tools around it. I figure if I keep getting dents around the top I'll probobly just use some boards and make a top rail to go around them and make them look nice.

These were very easy to assemble and look really nice in the yard. There's only one feature that I don't particularly care for, but it shouldn't be noticeable once the bed is full of plants. To preserve the faux wood finish, the sheets of metal come with a protective plastic covering, which I believe is intended to stay on the product (versus just for shipping purposes). On both raised beds that I purchased, there are lots of areas along the top edge where the plastic has bubbled or peeled, but it is not visible on the majority of the product. Since it is only noticeable on the top edges that will eventually be covered with plant foliage, I'm still very happy with the products themselves.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81UQJH7UNsL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Xnqm9uEjL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBB4B6T9H5VOJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BM5ZJWQP,-,-

"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2022",Hawke,yes,-,Really a pretty sturdy bed compared to two others.,"So, this is bed number 3 I ordered.  First thing I don't understand is how they say use gloves and actually provide you a pair when the screws, washers and bolts are so small that is almost an impossibility.  So that made putting it together a little difficult to put together.  I thought the directions were very simple to understand yet the timeframes they give you on putting these together is ridiculous.  This one is much sturdier yet some pieces were bent and/or damaged yet box was not damaged.  I would like to see bigger hardware to simplify and speed up the assembly.  I do like the fact that is has a lip around the top and bottom, especially the top and the cross braces seem to be a lot sturdier.  They should include a couple more of them.  Bed 1 and this one are in the running yet still looking at others hoping to find one that is sturdy, simple to assemble.  I always put cardboard down in these beds first and some flakes of old crappy hay.  Then added top soil/compost/manure.  This one took14 1 cu. ft bags yet will need more once it settles down.  Wanted to include some peat moss yet everyone seems to be out of stock on that one.  I would recommend purchasing this bed because of its sturdiness.

So what we did was have one person on one side line up panel holes as close as possible & hold them, while the other person inserted the screw, and used the screwdriver to hold it in while the person opposite screwed the wing nut down. We lined up first top/bottom holes then pushed and pulled to do the rest... we found this was most efficient after arguing and cussing with the first two panels. Once we figured out what to do as partners, it went fairly fast but still took a couple hours to fully assemble. Once we got it together, we were quite happy with appearance and with proper underlayment of rocks, etc. feel it will be quite secure beautiful raised garden bed.PROS:Sizing and height was exactly what I was looking for. 2ft height is a great size for a WHEELCHAIR ♿️ bound person or someone needing to sit and garden.8 foot X 4 foot is a great size for our small garden.Rounded edges are nice with the rubber capping for protection.CONS:• holes misaligned, some very badly.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2023",AskTheNerd,yes,yes,"Fine Containers, but Difficult Assembly","I just finished assembling the second one of these (6x3x2) planters. The first one took four hours. I was hopeful that the second would go faster, but it was still about the same time. I did both of them by myself. In the reviews people speak of holes not aligning. In general they don’t. Most of the problems are with side panels that become somewhat flattened during shipping. I found that if you do the top and bottom screws first, then the middle, that the rest will slip right in. Now, it’s not always trivial to get the top and bottom done and someone to help would make it much easier, but it can be done! Just a note, they give you gloves, but you really can’t wear them while you install screws and the unfinished edges are really sharp! (Yes, I did manage to cut myself!)The other thing that I would like to point out is that the assembled containers are very large and that they require a huge amount of solid material to fill them. I’m talking about 30 cubic feet or so! At typical prices you should figure more than $100 worth of filler, each!

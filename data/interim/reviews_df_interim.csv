2023-02-22,-,-,A great purchase when on sale,First I want to say that I got this for 119 I find this to be a fair price for a bed of this size I would not buy it for 175 or whatever price that is higher than 119 Why Because for a few bucks more I could get a 32 inch version that has paint protecting These are bare metal which I do assume will last quite a few years I hardly expect to last longer than the aforementionedThat being said This bed is great Its very thick and heavy steel You can treat it yourself if youre worried about rust which will cost extra money but give you the same results as one that is already paintedThe only reason I took stars off is due to that reason and the price without coupon If I were going to consider this at full price I would just go one step better and grab the painted onesThis also does not come with rubber edging which in my opinion is needed These get very hot in the summer to the touch also again because its not paintedSo do I recommend these That is a resounding yes IF you get them for around 119 Otherwise I would not recommend them for the reasons already mentioned 24 inches is a pretty perfect height for gardening and should keep a lot of unwanted animals out,3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IS0TDFVYV8XQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BG2HP1PJ,B0BG2HP1PJ,Size: 8x4x2FT（1PCS）,0.7749376893043518,0.0530372448265552,B0BG2HP1PJ,3,244,244,"{'role': 'assistant', 'content': None, 'function_call': {'name': 'review_data_function', 'arguments': '{\n  ""Review Summary"": ""Great bed, but better options available at higher prices"",\n  ""Topics"": ""{\\""price\\"": \\""fair\\"", \\""durability\\"": \\""thick and heavy steel\\"", \\""rust resistance\\"": \\""bare metal\\"", \\""painting\\"": \\""not painted\\"", \\""rubber edging\\"": \\""needed\\"", \\""height\\"": \\""perfect for gardening\\""}"",\n  ""Buyer Motivation"": ""Price"",\n  ""Customer Expectations"": ""Lasting for a few years"",\n  ""How the product is used"": ""Gardening"",\n  ""Where the product is used"": ""Outdoors"",\n  ""User Description"": ""Gardeners"",\n  ""Packaging"": ""Not mentioned"",\n  ""Season"": ""Not mentioned"",\n  ""When the product is used"": ""Not mentioned""\n}'}}","{'Review Summary': 'Great bed, but better options available at higher prices', 'Topics': '{""price"": ""fair"", ""durability"": ""thick and heavy steel"", ""rust resistance"": ""bare metal"", ""painting"": ""not painted"", ""rubber edging"": ""needed"", ""height"": ""perfect for gardening""}', 'Buyer Motivation': 'Price', 'Customer Expectations': 'Lasting for a few years', 'How the product is used': 'Gardening', 'Where the product is used': 'Outdoors', 'User Description': 'Gardeners', 'Packaging': 'Not mentioned', 'Season': 'Not mentioned', 'When the product is used': 'Not mentioned'}","Great bed, but better options available at higher prices","{""price"": ""fair"", ""durability"": ""thick and heavy steel"", ""rust resistance"": ""bare metal"", ""painting"": ""not painted"", ""rubber edging"": ""needed"", ""height"": ""perfect for gardening""}",Price,Lasting for a few years,Gardening,Outdoors,Gardeners,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,Not mentioned

The beads are very strongly magnetic and overall do not allow a smooth writing flow. It‚Äôs jerky and sometimes tough to move, and some balls pop up before you touch them. Also tapping the board can make the beads jump all over the board so some are up and others are down. I thought it would generate an interest in my child to practice writing but it didn‚Äôt work. Instead it was a fun toy to play with the beads with no regard to practicing the correct formation of a letter. Since she already knows her letters and sounds this did not provide any better learning experience for her writing. We do pop up all the beads and then trace the letter using our finger to push the beads down but this is an activity I do with my 2 year old.The board itself seems sturdy and hasn‚Äôt broken under the throwing and stomping and playing from my toddler. The pen fits well in the ha doe area and has a long springy string to connect it and the beads do pop up and down.

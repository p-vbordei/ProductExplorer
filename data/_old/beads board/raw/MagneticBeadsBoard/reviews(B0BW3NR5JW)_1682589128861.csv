No pieces to pick up when done playing. The cards are loose though and I wish that there was a pouch or something in the back of the toy to store those in. I recommend this product.",false,"[]"

The cards provided are bright and big for kiddos to see and having the card holder comes in handy. The only thing I would recommend is to make the pen more powerful.

My 3yr old loves detailed work. We noticed he moves things into patterns like toys, cars. etc. Moving these around to make designs is perfect for a little engineer. This is both good for visual, mental, and tactile development.The only downside is the pieces are a bit small. Having animals run around I would recommend keeping these far away from them and make sure to supervise your kid the entire time using them.",false,"[]"

I thought this would be a great toy to get them off the phones at least for an hour a day. First they couldn't figure out what to do with it. The baby thought it's a tablet and kept tapping it, finally she gave up thinking it's a broken tablet. After they figured it out they loved it for about a day and went back to tablets and phones. No wonder kids have attention span problems they can't play a simple game requiring only attention and imagination. Worth it though. If you want to wean your kids off technology this is a great toy.

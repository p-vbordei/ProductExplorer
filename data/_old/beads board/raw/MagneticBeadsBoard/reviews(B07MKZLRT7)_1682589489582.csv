I was excited by the thought that he would become familiar with the alphabet in a fun way, but he‚Äôs still too young. He doesn‚Äôt get that he should use the magnetic pencil to trace the letters. He treats the board like a noisemaker and shakes it and tries pushing the magnetic beads in with his fingers. I‚Äôve even caught him jumping up and down on it to make it rattle and surprisingly, it held up quite well under that kind of abuse. Not a single scratch or bend or crack it it. He‚Äôs too young to write and the magnetic pencil is short and stubby unlike a real pencil. Once my grandson learns to write he will understand he can follow the arrows to trace the letters.

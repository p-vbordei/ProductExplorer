It was a new toy for him since I did not show it to him until we went on vacation, so he did not get bored with it. It kept him occupied in the hotel and restaurants. It's been a few weeks, and he still plays with it. That is a big plus since this helps stimulate his imagination and increases our bonding time.The only negative were the small pieces it came with. But I just stored them away, so nothing hazardous for him to swallow.The board is lightweight for him to drag/carry around and small enough that I was able store it in his diaper bag with tons of room to spare.I highly recommend this.",false,"[]"

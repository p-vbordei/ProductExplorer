I was originally going to buy the version with the ABCs on it, but ultimately decided on the plain model so my kids could write/draw anything, including letters and numbers.I'm so glad I did because they love it! It's sturdy, allows for imaginative play, and is way more engaging than just paper and pencil, crayons, or even magna-doodle type toys. The ability to design your images one dot at a time really allows for intentional creations. They will play with it for an hour at a time, practicing letters and words, playing tic-tac-toe and pictionary, and finding new ways to write and erase with different shape magnets and other items. This would make a great gift for any kid.Note: Like many people, I rely heavily on Amazon reviews before making almost any purchase, online or in brick-and-mortar stores. I am always honest with my reviews. If I love something, I shout it from the rooftops. And if I hate it, I have no problem telling you that too.

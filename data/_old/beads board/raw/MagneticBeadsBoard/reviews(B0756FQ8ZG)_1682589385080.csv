Not at all like pictured or like the description suggest. Product picture clearly shows no grid lines on the ‚Äöscreen‚Äô. But it does come with grid lines. The drawings start to fade quickly and the result just looks bad. The stamps are so small that my toddler can choke because of them. I‚Äòm totally disappointed. When you paint the lines are very uneven and irregular. The rainbow color is a nice idea but it makes no sense to paint in yellow on a white screen. 1 star because my kid was able to use it. -5 stars that the stamps fit perfectly in his mouth - he loves to chew on them. -10 for the paintability. Housing looks cheap. I think i said everything.",false,"[]"

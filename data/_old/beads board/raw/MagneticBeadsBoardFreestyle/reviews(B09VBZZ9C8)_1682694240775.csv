The only thing I find that is a bit of an inconvenience is that if you flip the board over a lot of the magnets will stay up instead of falling back down in the holes. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying to have to push the magnets down each time even when you didn’t use the stylus to engage the magnet.",false,"[]"

I have three kids and this came in a three pack so I figured it would be perfect. Kids absolutely loved it BUT I would say the only drawback was the sound, especially on a road trip in a small space the sound of it got really annoying. So definitely would not be a good choice for a plane trip or church in my opinion.",false,"[]"

The magnetic pen can simply pull them out. We’ve managed to pop them back in each time. But seeing as how small they are, it won’t be long before we lose them. I can easily see this being very dangerous for a smaller child.",false,"[]"

It was very much enjoyable for all of them. I don’t think they really designed anything with them. It was just the simplicity of having all the pegs show and then erasing them to start over. These toys were passed around to their cousins and such for fun too.",false,"[]"

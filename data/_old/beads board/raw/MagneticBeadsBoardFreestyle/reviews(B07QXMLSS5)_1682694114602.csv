You pretty much have to poke the pen in every hole to pull the ball up. You cant just run the pen across and make the balls come up. Also, when drawing, you'll come across a situation where you will pull one ball up and the magnetism affects other balls that have been pulled up previously. itll create a repulsive force and make another ball someplace else fall. This is a horrible toy that never should have made it past testing. Its junk.",false,"[]"

Each age uses it a bit differently which is neat to see. Randomly doodles, practicing abcs and shapes, playing tic tac toe, or making more elaborate designs. I even have fun with it!

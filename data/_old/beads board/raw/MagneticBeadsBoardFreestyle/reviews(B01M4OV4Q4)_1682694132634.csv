Not only is it great for her fine motor skills, it has helped her develop her concentration. The magnetic stylus picks up the ball, which gets stuck in the hole, with a very satisfying ""click"". You can draw shapes with it, but just popping up the balls is so satisfying for all the kids. All my kids LOVE it as well as their friends. Another strangely enjoyable function is to push the balls back down with your fingertip. Three mother's who have come to our house on separate occasions and have seen the kids using this have purchased it for their kids.

It offers a pretty nice sensory experience: it exercises sight, sound, and touch simultaneously while drawing a picture. The stylus pulls the magnetic beads up pretty easily. The first time we opened it some of the beads got stuck in the ""up"" position and were quite hard to push back down again, but after a couple of times it's much easier to reset the toy to a blank slate again. My older son really likes things that glow in the dark so that aspect did appeal to us, and the case does definitely glow in the dark, but the design they've created is difficult to see when in the dark. Furthermore the blue color doesn't have the most contrast with the silver beads in the light, so it can even be hard to see the design in full light. Still, it's a nice fun toy.",false,"[]"

However, it barely glows, so don't choose it for this reason alone. The red has a better contrast between the silver beads and the background color, so visual detail is better. The blue one has a slightly larger size, if that's important to you, but I'm not sure it's enough to justify the price difference, since the glow in the dark feature doesn't work so well. Beyond that, the Magnatab is a great toy. The beads were really hard to push out the first use, but after that they came out easily.

And he loves the toy but he keeps asking why there's no dog.(He wanted this one because it had a dog, as opposed to another one that had a house.)In the grand scheme of things, it's very, very minor...but I still would like if they could do something on their packaging to make it more clear.",false,"[]"

Coral",4,"Ideal for ages 2 to 3","The media could not be loaded. Here’s a video of our 7 year old trying out the Magnatab.He thought it was cool for about 5 minutes and then got bored of it.There are not enough magnetic “pixels” to write his name or any words.Very coarse resolution for such purposes or any kind of detailed artwork.But when I gave it to our 3 year old toddler she loves it!She carries it around with her everywhere she goes.The tactile feel of the little balls popping out and and the sound captures her attention and curiosity to experiment more.She can draw happy faces and shapes on it.So from my experience, whether or not the kid will like it depends on the age range.",false,"[]"

It feels fun like popping bubble wrap but it is legit loud. I let me 3YO go crazy with it and I had to actually tell her to stop because the beads were too loud. She really likes using it though. She likes taking out the pen and putting it back. You can’t really see what you are drawing though. I couldn’t make out letters I wrote or shapes I drew. I think this would be fun for a car ride but it’s a bit too loud for us.",false,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71o3lcfGAnL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81+ROYKEAdL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

My daughter will sit and draw something out and take the time to push all the unwanted needs back down.We homeschool (pre-covid) and I thought this would be a great tool for drawing and pacticing numbers and letters, especially since they sell kits to traces your letters and numbers. I tried to draw a neat, single line letter and number and the magnet is so strong it pulls up random beads from a like or two over. You cannot do it neatly unless you spend a LOT of time going super slow or push the random one back down to make it look neat. If you just want to scribble, this maybe good for a toddler that is building finger/pencil gripping skills, but not as a drawing and writing tool. The last photo I tried to draw a single line up and down, and you can really see where it failed to do so neatly.",false,"[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E4Djx2J6L._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E4Djx2J6L._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yktzqFGzL._SL1600_.jpg"",""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81aiY3LZ4DL._SL1600_.jpg""]"

Everything about this toy is ideal!The Glow Magnatab is beautifully designed, with a calming blue color that glows pleasantly in the dark. The silver magnetic pen and the balls accent nicely, plus the Magnatab logo on the toy is a great touch. There is a sleek holder at the top, from which the magnetic pen can be easily removed and replaced, brilliant design! The large magnetic area of this version is amazing - there are almost 800 balls to create your designs, incredible!Let’s start with the play! Remove the pen, and if there are any magnetic balls raised, you can slide the side of the pen up and down the board to easily push the balls down and clear the board for your new design. You can also push individual balls down with your finger. Begin touching the chosen holes with the pen tip to start designing. You will immediately hear the pleasant “clack” of the magnetic balls pulling into place. Wonderful!Such a great Sensory experience - Visual, Auditory and Fine Motor skills will be activated, plus eye-hand coordination and visual planning - not to mention seemingly endless Super Fun! Highly recommend the Glow-in-the-Dark Magnatab for all ages over three, teens and adults will love it, too.The Magnatab is clearly well-made and durable, I absolutely consider this a lifetime toy, something that will last and be of interest ongoing. Definitely going on my Top Toy list!",false,"[]"

Maybe write a BIG warning label because they are not safe and dealing with a few kids at a time around a fire is already stressful enough so to make sure they leave theyâ€™re hands were they are supposed to is a lot especially because we all kids have a small attention span ðŸ˜… great concept but more ADULT FRIENDLY!only thing in idk why it lists all those products you can roast when it barley holds a big marshmallow (so with that said donâ€™t eat off the stick!)",false,"[]"

I find them extremely hard to clean, though. I wonder if Iâ€™d have better luck cleaning them if I used them for grilling veggies, but Iâ€™ve had these for a few years now and have only used them for marshmallows when making sâ€™mores. The marshmallows get stuck and it takes a lot of soaking and scrubbing to get them off.",false,"[]"

It extends a long way, it is stiff and less wobbly than the other kinds and then it collapses into a small, storable size after cleaning. All roasting sticks should be made like this.",false,"[]"

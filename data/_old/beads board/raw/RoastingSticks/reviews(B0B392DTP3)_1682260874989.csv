They are expandable which is nice. I like the quantity of sticks in this package. It was the right about for my bonfire party. I didn’t have high expectations for these, assuming they’d break quickly. But I think these will last for at least a few more bonfire parties. That’s good enough for me.",false,"[]"

My old ones did not telescope and they were hard to store and wash. These sticks are really easy to wash and are easy to store in the storage bag that was provided. Once stored they don’t take up much room at all. I hang them on the coat rack in our storage closet. I love how they are color coded so that the pickier people can have their own stick and don’t have to share with anyone else. They are sturdy enough to be able to roast 2 hot dogs at a time. Overall I am very pleased.",false,"[]"

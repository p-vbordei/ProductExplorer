The handles feel cheap but they have help up over three camping trips and once or twice being used at home. So, I give them five stars.Easy to clean.",false,"[]"

These worked. He also used it when he was burning a stump and he fixed us all hotdogs. He really likes them. He really likes the fact that they are telescopic and he doesnt have to be that close to the fire. They are a bit pricey, but they work.",false,"[]"

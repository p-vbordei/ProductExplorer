The corners of the assembled unit remain sharp, unlike the sides with their rolled edge. They've been installed in my yard for about a week now and I've cut myself twice. Going to work on a solution for that shortly. The main annoyance about these beds (I have two), is that they're shorter by 2 inches in both length and width than is advertised. I want to use the square-foot gardening method and this mainly means that I'll need to adjust my plantings a bit, but it is frustrating.I like these beds overall but am disappointed that they're smaller than I'd expected and planned for.",

Using a 3/8 box end wrench you will be able to after starting nut by hand hold it easily.A cordless drill is a necessity with a Phillips bit for the pan head bolts.Start with constructing both the ends completely. Then you can construct the side panel one level at a time from ground up. Do first level all the way around and then tie both halves together. Proceed to second level.I added two bolts on end panels where each level met. Additionally with all thread I added support 1/4th and 3/4th down length.I was impressed with the machining but gauge of steel was a disappointment. It will work though.",

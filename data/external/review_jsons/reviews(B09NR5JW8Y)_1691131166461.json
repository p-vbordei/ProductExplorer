        "text": "I wanted to add a raised bed to our backyard to house some shrubs and ground cover plants but didn't want to spend a fortune trying to create one and this planter box does the job nicely. At 6x3x1, it gives me 18 cubic feet to work with both in terms of depth of soil and overall area for planting. The metal bracing bars in the middle help keep it rigid while filling it and hold its shape over time but they also are a factor in terms of plant spacing and overall usage when it comes to determining what and where to populate it with. The assembly is pretty straightforward, it's a modular panel construction held together with bolts and wingnuts and took me about an hour working alone to get it all together. The exterior side has a protective shrink-wrap film over the woodgrain finish that I couldn't remove completely from all the panels but that's not something that bothers me to leave in place. The corner anchor stakes that come with it are a nice touch to hold it in place while filling it and it took 12 1.5 cu ft bags of Miracle-Gro garden soil and still had a little room at the top to work with, so the capacity is there according to the stated dimensions. The open bottom gives you the flexibility to move and place it and I was able to shift it myself from my living room where I assembled it to the backyard without any problems.",

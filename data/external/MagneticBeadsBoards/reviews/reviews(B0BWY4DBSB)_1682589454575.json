        "text": "My daughter loves this magnetic drawing board! The rabbit design is adorable and the large size provides enough space for her to draw and create. The colorful magnetic beads are so much fun and the double-sided cards with different patterns keep her entertained for hours. The double magnetic pens are also a great feature and the card slot design is very convenient. The material is safe and durable, which is very important for me. I highly recommend this as a great educational and travel toy for kids!",

        "text": "I like the idea of drawing a pixelated picture with magnetic pens and circles. It's not big, so you can take it wherever you want. A kid can play in the car, outside, or inside. Plastic prevents circles from getting out, so it's easy to carry.It comes with a set of example cards, I didn't have any issues with them. They were printed right and they are easy to follow.The bad side is the quality of the product, it is not so great. To move the dots you have to press a little bit on the plastic because of that it becomes scratched pretty easily.The top of the pen goes out while you are using it. As it has spring in it it can shoot it out and hit into a face. I would recommend gluing it right away.",

Some of the double-sided cards are printed too close to the edge and cut offI love the setup and concept, and really not that upset you have to press down a little bit to get the magnet to pick up the pieces b/c when we write, we have to put a little pressure. However, b/c of this, you scratch up the plastic easily and the quality is just not there for this. The magnet is clearly not strong enough for this.Overall, for approx $22 (at the time of this review) I do not recommend.",

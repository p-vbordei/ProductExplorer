I thought it would generate an interest in my child to practice writing but it didn‚Äôt work. Instead it was a fun toy to play with the beads with no regard to practicing the correct formation of a letter. Since she already knows her letters and sounds this did not provide any better learning experience for her writing. We do pop up all the beads and then trace the letter using our finger to push the beads down but this is an activity I do with my 2 year old.The board itself seems sturdy and hasn‚Äôt broken under the throwing and stomping and playing from my toddler. The pen fits well in the ha doe area and has a long springy string to connect it and the beads do pop up and down. It has upper case letters on one side and lower case on the other with directionalarrows for how to form the letter but little incentive to actually follow it.",

It shot out like a missile.We had to explain to her not to do that because she could have hit someone and hurt them.The board is educational in a fun way and it is nice that it is two-sided - capital letters on one side and lowercase letters on the other rather than having 2 separate boards.

I wanted this for practice writing but it is just frustrating for the child because the writing tool really takes a jolt as they move down the path to write.The kids still love trying but they don't really follow the correct form of writing so it works against learning the correct way which of great importance. The side with uppercase letter is better but still difficult. I love that the vowels are red and constanants are blue since we practice those vowels more. I'm overall dissapointed and would not recommend. If the board was larger to allow for larger letters it would be helpful.",

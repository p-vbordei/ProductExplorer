My son was able to figure it out right away and also really enjoyed it. There’s ZERO chance of making a mess or losing pieces so it’s great for the car or a plane.Cons- slightly noisy though I don’t mind. Main issue, and reason I said ALMOST perfect is that some of the holes are just slightly smaller and the metal balls fall down as soon as you pull them up. Not a huge issue given the price but if I had bought this as a mindfulness exercise for myself I’d also have to work on my patience and acceptance 😆Overall worth the money especially for travel",

The magnetic beads inside rattle loudly when shifted, but it also makes very noisy clacking sounds when the magnetic bead is drawn up or pushed back down. It is actually astounding how loud it can be. I expected maybe a small amount of noise but it’s quite amplified. There’s just no way to prevent it.

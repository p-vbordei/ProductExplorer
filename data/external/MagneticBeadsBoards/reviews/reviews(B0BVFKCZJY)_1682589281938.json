        "text": "What I love:- fun activity for small children, toddler age and up.- sealed design, so I don't have to worry about missing magnets or choking hazards. Still use only under adult supervision due to the potential for the case to break.- 5 colors makes this simple for little kids.- the case is fun!- lots of designs to copy- a slot for the card to stand in while you copy the design- slot to keep the magnet pen.- relaxing activity!- easy to use! The pen holds the magnet pieces and drags them into place easily.What I don't love:- the quality of the sealed compartment is lacking. The sheet is already scratched after only a few days. It feels loose, like you can move it around, and press on the sheet and it dips in. For a toy with magnets, advertised for 3+, a high quality sealed compartment should have been a priority. I think it's a thin plastic sheet like you'd expect on a dollar store toy? It should have been something significantly stronger.Overall, the quality makes me feel like this should be a $10 ($15 tops) toy, for which I'd recommend. 2 stars off for quality, since I'll most likely toss this once the sheet is broken and at $20 that feels like a very bad price (not to mention bad for the environment).I love everything else about this, though! If the quality of materials were improved this would easily be 5 stars because it's a fun activity! I even like using it myself, to be honest.",

The cards reek of chemical smell. The front plastic is thin and flimsy, not thicker material like they used to have. It also scratches very easily. Some of the discs were not smoothly shaved, leaving rough edges which makes some hard to set. The indents are very deep, so it's harder to get the pieces to stay put. And the amount of colored discs are unbalanced. Also, the small size uses the same casing as the bigger one, but holds much fewer pieces than what would actually fit.It would be fun for some kids, but with a more limited number of variable colors and a very limited quantity of each, some much more than others, It only hampers some creativity and therefore has a decreased replay value.It is a horrible, but it isn't great either. It could be so much better with a few quality improvements on manufacturing and materials.",

It comes with 14 designs, 2 on each of the 7 cards, to mimic. Once the pen is removed, a card can be placed in the small opening for the card to stand up. It's best to slightly put it in. Otherwise pushing the card all the way down will cause it to tilt a little.The drawing board has a clear covering with visibility to the colorful magnets. The magnets looks like a popular candy. It's easy to move the magnets into the empty circles to make the design on one of the card designs or to make ones own design.Titling the board down removes the magnets from the circular spaces.Since it's a kids toy, laminated cards would be helpful. It would also be nice if there were more cards; perhaps to include the alphabet or numbers or shapes.This would be a really fun concept for a multipack for adults to compete against eachother; even for team building.I certainly recommend the magnetic drawing board.",

        "text": "This is a fun fidget toy for my 4.7 yr old. He can do it just fine and seems entertained for at least one drawing at a time. I like the concept a lot, and hope it would last. The front clear panel is a thin piece of plastic and I worry that it would break from any messing around. The magnet at the tip of the pen is exposed and scratches this surface each time you move a stone, so that would add to the fragility. I wish the tip of the pen was covered with something soft so it doesn‚Äôt scratch like that. The colors are bright and bold.The pattern card can be put into a slot at the top of the game. The pen goes in there too, but in only one direction which you learn from trial and error. There is no place to put the cards while not drawing, so I ended up keeping the box to contain the parts.",

The frontclear plastic casing pushes right down onto the inner plastic piece. It feels as if it will break easily. Also, it has scratches all over from just a few uses. There aren't as many circles to place the magnets as with others. There are empty gaps on 3 sides instead of just at the bottom. The pen picks up and moves the magnets well, and it is fun to play with. You can make the designs on the little cards or go freestyle. The pieces remind us of M&Ms. My kids like this toy; I just wish it was built better to hold up and last longer.",

The toy itself is made pretty well and the magnetic dots work pretty well; however, you do have to have patience and make sure this board is completely flat. I noticed that if you have the board at an angle of any sort, it will not work as well. The magnetic pen does work pretty well but you will notice sometimes it takes a couple of times for it to pick up a dot. After noticing that this requires a lot more motor skills than my toddler can do, I feel like this will be better for when he's a few years older.",

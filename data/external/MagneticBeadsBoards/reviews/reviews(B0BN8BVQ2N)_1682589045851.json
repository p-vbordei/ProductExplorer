        "text": "So for this you use a magnetic pen and you \"draw\" by placing the colored magnetic circles into holes. The whole thing is sealed so you don't have to worry about plastic M&M lookalike things flying everywhere. It's a fun activity once you get the hang of it. The hardest part of actually using it I think is when the dots are laying on top of each other and you're trying to get the bottom one. But the acrylic or clear plastic part flexes a little so you can press down. It comes with patterns or you can be creative and carve your own path..There are 2 issues that you should be aware of. The magnetic pen is not tethered to the rest of the toy so it can be lost. It's bright yellow but it's also not very wide. If your child is meticulous about putting stuff back together then odds are good it'll stay intact.The other is that the acrylic piece gets scratched up on use. Over time it'll get hazier and I'm not sure howmuch longer it can take toddler scrape-age and still be pleasant to look at it. It has been over a month for us though with occasional use and it looks mostly okay, but the scratches are noticeable. I'd say 8/10 condition.Overall, a fun activity that stays mostly together and the cleanup isn't painful at all. However, the scratches in the plastic screen and the fact that the magnetic pen is liable to get lost are a bit annoying. (strong fridge magnets will work though). So it gets 4 stars.",

        "text": "This toy has entertained my son for so long now. It was tricky at first, but he was able to figure out how to move the colored circles on his own using the pen. I could see his dexterity improving in only a matter of 15 minutes. He’s also been able to practice color sorting using this toy. I love that it’s mess free and while I think it would be great on a flight, the toy itself is quite large and not sure if I would end up having room for this.My one issue with this is that I wish the pen could somehow stay connected to the board. Even if it was as simple as having a hole and I could thread a piece of string, I would be happy. That’s another reason I’m not sure if I would bring this on a flight, because of the potential to lose the pen.Besides that, it’s a great toy!",

        "text": "We bought this board for our 2-year-old son, and it is one of my favorites so far! While our son is not old enough to truly start to create shapes using this yet, he still found it fascinating that he could drag the magnetic beads around with the pen and started placing them around the board. It actually didn't take him as long as I thought it might to figure out the workings of the board - he was moving the beads around at will probably within the first minute. The magnet on the pen looks very strong, so even when our son was doing it, he didn't really have much of an issue holding on to them and moving them around.The board even comes with cards that have recommended patterns you can try. These will probably come in handy as he gets older, as he figures out how to follow along with them.The two minor complaints that I have with the board are: (1) I wish there was another pen included to allow two kids (or a kid and a parent) to work on this at the same time, especially given its decent size; and (2) I think the pen should have been tied to the board via some sort of a string; I am afraid it will be very easy to lose the pen as it detaches completely from the board. Especially given that both are things that you can see from the product pictures before buying, I didn't take any stars off for them.",

When I saw this I had to get it for her.The version my parents have allows the paper image to slide behind the screen so it operates like a paint-by-number game. She drags the appropriately colored chip to the spot on the board where it shows a dot on the image of that color you can see through the screen.Con: Too advanced for the ages shown.This is free form.It would require a child to comprehend for example a blue dot is 4 circles in, 5 circles up from the bottom, and place the dot there.Unless the child is advanced, I do not see this for younger than kindergarten. I tried it myself and was counting circles for the first few dots to get parts of the outline in the right spots before I started filling in the rest.Con: Lose Pen.While this was portrayed in the images, the pen is NOT attached to the board by a string, so I give it one time of being thrown in the toy bin for it to be lost amongst all the other toys.I'll need to buy and superglue a string to the board so it stays attached.",

My son is obsessed with this toy and loves to just drag the beads all over the board. He’s young and doesn’t really care about making pictures and just has a blast moving the beads from space to space.One big plus that sets this aside from the dozens of other magnetic boards on Amazon is the fact that this comes with a string that attaches the pen to the board. This is huge. My son lost the pen to the other board almost immediately and it was such a pain to find… only for him to lose it again within a day. The pen on this board is tethered to the unit, but has a long enough slack where you can still use it with full range of motion. It’s kind of annoying to have the string get in the way every once in a while, but I’d much rather deal with that than deal with a constantly lost pen.Overall, love this board. My family has a lot of fun with it; highly recommended.",

The rope on it is long enough to go anywhere on the tablet surface. The front plastic is thin, can break, and will scratch over time.

The pen was difficult to control and did not work well with the board's drawing surface.Finally, and most importantly, I am concerned about the safety of this product.The thin plastic casing and weak magnetic components make it a hazard for children, as it can easily break and expose sharp edges or small pieces.Overall, I do not recommend this magnetic drawing board to anyone, as it is of low quality, poor durability, and a safety hazard. I would suggest looking for alternative products that are sturdier, safer, and more reliable.",

When you paint the lines are very uneven and irregular. The rainbow color is a nice idea but it makes no sense to paint in yellow on a white screen. 1 star because my kid was able to use it. -5 stars that the stamps fit perfectly in his mouth - he loves to chew on them. -10 for the paintability.

I didn't see any temperature constraints on the box, so I'm going to keep this one in the car as well. Hopefully it holds up better than the first one. I added a star for customer service, but I'd look for the newer model, and not get this specific one.We got this for my toddler (2) to draw in the car. She can't get the shapes out by herself and she can't erase it by herself, so that's frustrating. She can only draw so long before filling the screen. It's been in the car toy box for about 3 months now, and the screen seems to be losing some of the pixels. Maybe because it's been cold 🤷 but that's a bit disappointing. We just got a LCD drawing tablet and like it way better.",

I do like how it has a red blue green yellow background. It is nice that the stylist is on a string. I wish they did that with the magnets because those were lost within the hour of it being opened. The magnets are also very small and a baby chokeable.Overall I wouldnt buy it for my 4 year old again, and it the screen is too small for my 7 year old to enjoy.",

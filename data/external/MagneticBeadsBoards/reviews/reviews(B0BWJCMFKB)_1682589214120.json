She is drawing with charcoals on paper but wasn't precise, and I though of getting this board to help her refine her movements. It actually worked from the first time.While on paper she was drawing randomly and out of context, with this board, she was using the pen extremely accurate.Very fun overall.Only drawback, the pen would be nice to have a slight stronger magnet so that the pen could operate at an angle. It needs to be perpendicular to the board to function. Not that bad though.",

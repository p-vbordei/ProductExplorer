Our disappointment mostly comes from the fact that when you use the pen to draw the image shows up and then fades almost completely away within seconds. The magnet shapes work better than the pen but the pen is what’s used the most. I’m not sure if this is the way they all are, or if we just got a defective one; either way, I would not recommend this product because of it. The travel size one work better but the full size one does not work as it should.",

I am certain I could buy one of better if not equal quality for much less at the dollar store. Not worth the money. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is for the small board and because my 16 month old will still try to draw on them both because she doesn't understand the pictures aren't supposed to fade...Save your money if you ask me.",

We barely had this for a few weeks before the eraser bar in the back broke off the little wiper so it could no longer be erased. I loved that the magnets were bigger than other brands so that they wouldn't fit in my child's mouths and become a choking hazard but I wish the actual board was a bit more heavy duty as a toy for children!

This is hands down the favorite one I’ve gotten yet!! It is so much better than your traditional drawing board as the sand inside the boards is rainbow colored rather than just plain Jane gray. There is different sections of different colors keeping the child intrigued. It comes with the magnets to make shapes as well as numerous stencils for the kids to trace. My youngest received this is a Christmas present and he is obsessed with it. We take the smaller one in the car for him to play with. It is pretty durable as well as he has thrown them multiple times and they have eat to break or even crack. This is great for children of all ages as my 10 year old even gets entertainment out of it. So if your looking for something fun that provides a little color behind the sketch than this is the toy for you!-one satisfied mommy.",

It draws really smoothly too almost like those old ones from back In the day that had the magnetic stuff in them you could drag around, it feels like that.

His Early Head Start teacher suggested something like this to me, and after overwhelmingly looking at all the many options available on Amazon, I finally went with this one. And I'm happy with my choice. And although I have not given it to him yet, because it is for Christmas, I did open it to test it out. It works great! And I love that it is colored! Also love the that it comes with a travel size one that I can bring with us too appointments and such to keep him occupied! It erases very easily! And I'm going to love this, cause no messy clean up, which is great, because I have OCD! Lol! Love this product! It also came with an insert to contact them on Facebook and get a free toy as a gift, so I did, and when I did, it was a bot that I was talking to at first. Then later that evening, I was contacted by a real person from this company. And they were so nice and friendly! We even just chatted about my son! So if you want to buy from a company that is going to actually communicate with you, this would be the one! They are so nice and friendly! Great service! And a great product!",

        "text": "I’ll have to remember to add a picture later, but I wanted to write this before I forget. I bought this for my 3 year old niece who was coming to stay with me for a few days from out-of-state while her parents took a trip with friends. I bought this the day before she arrived & as promised, it was delivered the very next day (for free too). My niece LOVED both of the magnadoodle things that came together! She really had a fun time with the magnets that are shapes. Ha the moment she started she asked how we were going to save all her pieces of art, so to appease her I took a pic of every single creation lol. She enjoyed this thing every day she visited & was so bummed she couldn’t take it home with her….until I showed her the travel sized one she could have! Ha boy was she excited about that. Her father (my brother) told me she’s played with extremely cheap ones before, but she never enjoyed them because they broke instantly & didn’t work right. He told me those were like $0.99 each though, so I’m not surprised. While it obviously is not recommended, I watched (& corrected) my niece slam the magnets or pen into the screen a good few times (while I cringed), yet each time it held up with zero damage. That was a pleasant surprise. I was originally torn between an old fashioned etcha sketch or one of these, but I was sold on the multi-colors aspect of this one. I highly recommend this item if you’re looking for some good ole non-electronic entertainment for young ones. Actually, I remember enjoying my etcha sketch until I was pretty old ha. This company is great to deal with as well. They offered 6 free stickers if I contacted on Facebook (the item came with one of the stickers & myself & the niece loved it, so I had to get the additional 6). I contacted them to see if they could mail them to my nieces address instead of mine & they had no problem with it. Thanks again to them for that & these sweet magnadoodles!!!! :)",

I was skeptical that it was a scam, but they were legitimate. About 2 weeks later they sent a pack of bathroom stickers of animals which he also loves! I am very satisfied with this company and their products. I would definitely recommend them. It’s also a great deal for the money.",

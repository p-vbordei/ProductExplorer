The included cards with ideas to replicate on the board are really fun, although I wish there was a place to store them on the back!! But being able to stand them up in front is great. It's really fun and easy to use, and feels like decent quality materials. The clear plastic front was already getting scuffed from use on the first day, which is a little disappointing, but doesn't bother my kids or interfere with its use. I love that there's no way to lose any of the pieces, and it's encouraging kids to be creative and get away from screens.",

It's easy to move the pieces, just make sure the pen is straight up and down. The only thing that is a bummer is that there's no where to store the cards. I would think some built-in clips or a pocket to hold them onto the back of the board would have made sense. There's room for that. Alas, they'll most likely get lost.

The magnetic wand works great to grab them, and the plastic cover is sturdy, but still thin enough to allow you to move them freely. This is a winner in my book.

The large magnetic board and colorful magnetic dots provide endless opportunities for creativity and imaginative play.I appreciate that this toy also has educational value, as it encourages fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It's also a great way for kids to practice drawing and writing without wasting paper.The board is well-made and durable, and the magnetic dots are strong enough to stay in place but easy enough for little hands to manipulate. It's also easy to wipe clean when playtime is over.Overall, I highly recommend the Cheffun Magnetic Drawing Doodle Board for Kids as a fun and educational toy for kids of all ages. It would make a great Easter or birthday gift! 5 stars!",

All the magnets are behind plastic, so there is no mess or fear of pieces getting lost. I would love it if there was a pouch on the back for the patterns, but I have put them in a bag and so far nothing has happened to them; we just keep the bag and the board together.This would be a great toy for a car trip, quiet time, or any time a child could use something to do that is creative, a little challenging, quiet, and easy to clean up!",

The only problem is that you lose the little pegs and the vacuum would eat them. This really is an improvement on it. You don't have to purchase more of the black papers to put into the machine. It's self contained.It's such a great gift for a creative child who loves to draw, but their drawing surface sometimes includes the walls of the house! Been there too many times.I like that it also is fun for adults. Kind of like those coloring books for adults.The plastic is good quality. I worry about the surface getting scratched up over time. it would be great if there was a 'screen protector' that you could just pull off when it gets scratched and throw on a new one.There will be many hours of fun from this creative toy. And the bonus that I really like is that there's nothing electronic about it! A win-win.",

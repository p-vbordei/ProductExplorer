The sound can actually be a bit irritating, especially if you have a headache. I originally bought it for our plane trip,, but the second i pulled it out of the package and heard all the little metal balls rolling around,, i figured i spare the sanity of the other passengers and pack it away for another day. All that being said, neither my 3 year old nor 1 year old were interested in it longer than a quick look at it. Ive used it more than them but even i don't find it particularly enjoyable. 4/10 recommend as it does seem like good quality, it's just not for us.",

I originally bought it for our 1.5 year old, so that she could work on her fine motor skills. She absolutely loves it. Not only is it great for her fine motor skills, it has helped her develop her concentration. The magnetic stylus picks up the ball, which gets stuck in the hole, with a very satisfying \"click\". You can draw shapes with it, but just popping up the balls is so satisfying for all the kids. All my kids LOVE it as well as their friends. Another strangely enjoyable function is to push the balls back down with your fingertip. Three mother's who have come to our house on separate occasions and have seen the kids using this have purchased it for their kids. (I myself bought it after seeing my children use it at someone else's house.) I seldom take the time to write reviews, but really, this toy is a real winner.",

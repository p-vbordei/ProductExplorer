Most everything that is advertised as writes in the shower/rain is too small, disposable, or doesn't work with water or humidity. It wasn't until remembering this toy from my childhood that I found something that works. It isn't perfect but good enough to write down some key words and revisit after the shower. As for it's quality, it is pretty much the same as all those years ago; which is also just good enough. The drawings always had a bit of blurriness to them. The \"pen\" doesn't write fine lines. And, it could erase better. But, all in all, it is doing what I need it to do and I'd imagine the kids wouldn't mind the downsides. So still a good gift/toy at a price that seems reasonable in todays market.",

He has a cheap mini one from Dollar Tree and loves it, so I decided to order him a larger version. It came today and of course he loves it, he's 2, but I was very disappointed. It is very cheap plastic that is likely to break if he happens to throw it during a 'terrible two tantrum', and it's very hard to slide the eraser slider- he literally can't unless I help him. The screen is super sensitive to touch, also. A finger can write on it, no need for the magnetic pen....which kind of defeats the purpose.I will say though, I do blame myself for ordering without paying closer attention to the brand of it, as I have always been disappointed with Crazy Art merchandise that I have purchased in the past. Lesson finally learned on my part.I will just keep it instead of the hassle of returning it, only because my son does love the concept. But, it is definitely disappointing. There are SO MANY different types/styles/brands on the market now, I definitely wouldn't purchase this one again- and certainly not give it as a gift.",

The red lever does not glide smoothly and it takes all the might of an adult to erase it after several tries. I bought this because my son had one that looks just like it in the early 90's. I was so disappointed in the lack of quality of this new \"retro\" version. There are 2 magnetic drawing tools, a circle and a star that are suppose to be stored in the unit. As soon as you pick it up they fall out because the magnets inside the housing aren't strong enough to hold them in place. Going to send this one back and order one made by a different company.",

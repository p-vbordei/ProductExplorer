        "text": "The doodle board is a great, low tech, non-screen-time form of entertainment for my child. The magnetic drawing board is a good shape and large size for kids. The picture cards give alot of ideas and are fun to try to duplicate on the board. The magnetic pen is actually attached by a string so it makes the board easy to keep together. The whole thing is sealed so you don't have to worry about plastic M&M lookalike things flying everywhere. It's a fun activity once you get the hang of it. It seems this was a good toy for younger kids 3-4 because they can make their own designs and for older kids 5-9 because they can recreate the designs on the cards.",

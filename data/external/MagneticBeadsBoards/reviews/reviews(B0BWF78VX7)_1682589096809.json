        "text": "My daughter loves this! It’s keeps her entertained for long periods of time. The stencils help her with color matching. We’ve even been using it to help with counting as well. The design is very smart because it’s resembles Mickey or Minnie Mouse ears which she loves so made it even more appealing to her. Love that it comes with a handle because we take it with us on the go! It’s def a better option than take her tablet with us everywhere. Very happy with this product!",

        "text": "This toy needs to be held relatively horizontal to work but I've found the magnets and colored discs to be very responsive and easy to move around. It comes with a LOT of cards, so many that most don't fit in the slot for storage (I was able to slide in six easily) which means some of the cards may get lost over time. The cards themselves are a thicker cardstock, though I can see them getting ripped if a child is determined. The tablet itself feels really sturdy and I'm glad we won't have to worry about tiny pieces being lost (or swallowed).",

The board comes with cards that you can slide behind the plastic and make different shapes and patterns to copy or create your own patterns. I Love that it’s mess free, you won’t loose the pieces and it’s safe for my son to use. It’s a great travel toy to bring with you to restaurants or traveling in the car ect.. it also seems like good quality that it’s not coming apart.",

You use the pen to move the dots to create pictures. You get cards that have pictures that you can duplicate with the dots and wand. So much fun. I decided to make the bicycle! 4 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. My unit arrived a bit scratched on the front. The string was secure and fit nicely in the slot on the top. I love there is a carry handle too. Multiple cards so you can make many different pictures.",

The \"pen\" does a good job of writing and can easily be held by his small hand. The stamps all work well to make shapes and draw with. The clearing swipe does a good job of clearing the board usually in 1 swipe, but usually no more than just an out and back will have it completely clean.

It said it was bigger and it had color so I thought great, boy was I wrong it is bigger but not in a good way, my son's other board had a cushion in the back so it was more comfortable traveling on his lap, this one there's nothing back there it's flat hard plastic and since it's so big he has to fit it awkwardly on his lap. Like ok the screen is big but the body doesn't have to be big too. Also it doesn't erase completely, the slider is so cheap you can hear it scraping trying to erase, and if you draw in the corner good luck it's never going to get it. I'm sending it back with drawings still on it because it couldn't get the edges lol.",

It is VERY easy for kid to accidentally get the slider off of its plastic track and we have to re-attach it or it stops erasing properly.For the price I guess it's fine but be warned. Definitely not a travel thing unless you're in a contained place like your own car.

        "text": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4yo daughter.I remember having one as a kid so I wanted her to have one.I actually bought 2,this magnetic board and the new LCD drawing board.I think she likes this one better,she uses it more.Its bigger and can easily see what your drawing.Finally a toy that she plays with everyday and hasnt been forgotten about! Pros-Lightweight,the shapes have magnets so they don't fall out and get lost,Bright colors,Long enough string on the pen reaches all areas.Erases easily.Handle so kids can carry and go without the shapes falling out.Cons-I only found 2 very small cons.That the back has no cover,to make it more smooth when drawing on your lap.Also it moves around easily when on a hard flat surface like my kitchen table,especially when erasing.The Pros outway the Cons making this the perfect magnetic drawing board! I've been caught playing w it a few times.Lol If your looking for one of these and don't know which one to buy grab this one is was the #1 best seller when I bought it.Ill add pictures and a video.If this review was helpful please hit the helpful button.Thanks!",

The pen is secured with a tether to prevent loss as well.Only reason it’s 4 stars instead of five is the center of the writing area is flimsy.

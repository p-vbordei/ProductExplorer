He doesn’t get that he should use the magnetic pencil to trace the letters. He treats the board like a noisemaker and shakes it and tries pushing the magnetic beads in with his fingers. I’ve even caught him jumping up and down on it to make it rattle and surprisingly, it held up quite well under that kind of abuse. Not a single scratch or bend or crack it it. He’s too young to write and the magnetic pencil is short and stubby unlike a real pencil. Once my grandson learns to write he will understand he can follow the arrows to trace the letters. Save this for when you have time to sit with your child and teach them how to use it as a tool.",

They got it for Christmas and I’m amazed that they still pull it out. That’s what prompted me to write this review!!It’s definitely worth the money and I even find it fun to play with.The ONLY complaint I have, like other reviewers, is that the pen is not connected to the board, and it will be easily lost.

We’ve only had it two days and it’s starting to smear everywhere all over his fingers and I’m worried that the letters will rub off all together.

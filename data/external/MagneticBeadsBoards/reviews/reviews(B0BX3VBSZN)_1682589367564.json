It wouldâ€™ve been even better if the pen was attached but I just have to make sure we donâ€™t lose it. The magnetic tip is not as strong as I wouldâ€™ve hoped for but it still works. You sometimes drop a piece because it does not stick well. The provided book for ideas is not something that can be attached to the board so we did not really use it at all. It arrived looking more like an instruction manual, not design ideas. Overall, this is a great toy for creative play",

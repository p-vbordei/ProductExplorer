Application Summary


Based on the additional code snippets provided:



reporting.py - Contains functions to generate a PDF report from the modeling results. Uses GPT-3 to generate full natural language report content, then renders as a PDF.

To summarize:


The main components are:

app.py - Implements a Flask API with routes for user management, starting investigations, generating modeling results.

etl.py - Handles extracting review data from a Firestore database and preparing/cleaning it for analysis. Uses asynchronous methods with asyncio.
investigations.py - Functions for creating and tracking investigation records in Firestore.
modeling.py - Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze review data, define the key problem statement, and generate proposed engineering solutions.
analysis.py - Full pipeline for vectorizing reviews with embeddings, clustering, analyzing clusters to identify topics/issues, labeling clusters, and extracting key issues.
users.py handles all user and investigation data management with Firestore
Modeling results are generated and stored for each investigation
The main app.py ties this together by exposing routes to create users, start investigations, run modeling, and generate reports
So in essence, the full pipeline is:

Onboard and manage users
Create investigations for products
Run analysis and modeling to identify issues/solutions
The different modules work together to enable this end-to-end workflow driven via the Flask API application.


The Flask API will prepare the data to be presented to the FrontEnd via a API.

      "Review text: We researched materials for our raised beds for a very long time.  My wife had a vision for her vegetable garden and was incredibly disappointed when we finally decided her first choice material of cedar was going to be just too expensive.  We thought galvanized would be our next option but she really didn't want the look of the steel so we opted for the black.  We saved (literally)hundreds by going with these black galvanized beds and we were both pleasantly surprised and impressed with the entire experience.  While waiting for the order we spent a lot of time watching youtube videos about \"mistakes\" and the \"hassles\" of putting together galvanized beds, and honestly, made ourselves anxious for no reason.Putting these beds tother IS time-consuming but NOT hard.  The larger 4X8 beds are easier with two people (just because of the number of screws and bolts you have to use and lining up the longer side pieces) but my wife actually did the 4X4 beds herself in under an hour each.So don't let the videos or other negative experiences scare you off.  That said here are some tips I'd advise:Most importantly- the flatter your surface the better the beds are going to sit and look. We did a lot of leveling before placing the beds and you can clearly see where we did a better job than not.  (I would also advise putting these beds together on a flat hard surface such as a patio, driveway, etc, then placing them where you want. It just makes lining up the pieces SO much easier)Here's what I learned from other reviewer's experiences that are worth paying attention to:  the reviewer \"runtails\" gave great advice in saying \"it is important although not immediately obvious, that the four corner pieces are oriented so the holes for the stability poles are all down\" and I would not have even noticed that had I not read that review first (and probably would have ended up having to take apart and put back together pieces)I also read a few reviews talking about receiving damaged products or the material \"scratching\" easily. Fortunately, we received all 4 of our beds in perfect condition and because I had read about the scratching, we were very careful in handling the pieces so they didn't scratch. We even kept the plastic coating lining the pieces until they were assembled and placed and I think this helped.We purchase 4 beds for about what it was going to cost us to build 2 cedar beds and I am thrilled with how it turned out.  Not only would I not hesitate to recommend these beds, but we'll also be ordering more beds next season to add.  They work well and are esthetically beautiful and I can't wait to get the paths mulched and the area fenced in.  As my wife noted, \"this is going to look even better than I envisioned!\"\n",

      "Review text: The product is nice and light weight but the packaging was a minimal most every corner was bent. I had to bend back and damage them to be able to assemble. The metal pieces are all plastic covered to avoid damage (awesome) which seems great but as soon as it is removed the surface will scratch VERY easily. I will probably have to paint. I expected more for the cost.Update: One year after install there are several sections with significant rust creating holes on the sides.  I am going to paint with a rust protector in hopes of extending the life of the raised garden, but after only one year this might be a bust.\n",

      "Review text: We just put 4 of these raised garden beds together over the weekend.Pros: easy to move, fairly easy to put together with 1 person. Looks niceCons: Instructions don't call out that the hole needs to be at the bottom for the stakes. The rubber top seems like it will come off easily and it came in one long strip that you have to manually cut. It wasn't hard to cut but it seemed like an easy thing to do. The sides are a bit more flimsy than I was expecting. The paint also seems to scrape off way too easily, especially on the overlapped part so now I wonder if it will rust. For being powder coated I expected a more durable surface. The instructions also say to check every 90 days if the bolts are loose. How will that be possible when it is full of 2ft of dirt? It seems like a locking washer would be a good idea. The tabs on the inside supports are also weird and they also scrape the paint off when installing. The instructions aren't clear on which way is up and the tabs have to be bent into place and then the angle of the corrugated ridges makes for a weird fit.I bought 2 more, we will see over time how they hold up. I am expecting in 3 years I will be spray painting the exterior due to rust.  They are pretty and have a lot of space. They are one of the few raised beds I was able to find that are very deep.\n",

      "Review text: For $150, you essentially get what you pay for.I did LOTS of shopping around and finally landed on this item. I ordered four. The first took about 1.5 hours to build, then each afterward just shy of an hour. I assembled almost entirely by myself; the only part I needed help with was fastening the very-bottom screws.The dimensions are as described. The metal sheets are a bit thin, but once again, it matches the price point. All four came in and delivered undamaged; they were packaged pretty well.Advice for assembling: lay out all items ahead of time. I also used a Kobalt ratcheting screwdriver for tightening down the wing nuts. The maintenance also mentions to retighten over time (impossible, filled with dirt), so I used Loctite as I assembled to make sure the fasteners wouldn't loosen.Keep in mind, this review is after assembly and not after year(s) of continual use. I will update my review if I feel the beds don't stand up to typical use.\n",

      "Review text: I'm a banged-up old retired instructor, and it still only took about an hour to assemble by myself.  That said, I still have about 30 minutes of work left.  The trick to easy assembly is to leave all 96 fasteners loose during assembly.  This makes lining up the holes a breeze.The next task, after tightening everything, will be scraping up 128 cubic feet of yard waste and bio-mass to fill the bed.  I'll top it with 4\"-5\" of garden soil.The bed feels lightweight and flimsy, but clearly, once it's filled it will be a very solid mass.  I'm looking forward to another 32 square feet of raised garden bed.\n",

Also, a panel laid in the grass (for only one hour) - killed all the grass.  A bit scarey.Although they look nice.  These are nearly impossible to \"Not Scatch\"  The coating is super thin and scratch easily.Also, take note that the seller makes you pay postage to return - which I found disqusting.

      "Review text: I have 5 other garden beds aside from this one from a different company. I purchased one of these before I bought more so this is garden bed number 6.These are my pros and cons.ConsThis was the most time consuming and tedious garden bed I've put together. I'm middle aged and fairly in good shape but being hunched over for a long period of time trying to get all 10 screws and nuts in (30 per side) hurt.The corners were bent due to the poor quality of plastic that covered the corners.The metal rails for support in the middle of the beds are super super poor quality and very flimsy so be careful with assembly and bending the metal so much.ProsThe metal is heavy duty.The color is nice.I liked that the outside part that had the plastic protective film to prevent scratching.I like that it came with a rubber protective guard for the top but honestly it isnt needed. The metal does have any sharp edges and isnt thin enough to hurt.If this company has other designs I may try another one out but I wont be getting another one of these just because of how tedious, time consuming, and some of the quality issues I faced.\n",

As we assembled the unit, the panels threatened to bend, in the strong breeze, and each time one would brush against another, the paint was left scratched.  Also, the three support braces, across the middle, are very thin aluminum and bent badly before we got the dirt inside.  Hopefully, the unit will last a few years, anyway.\n",

So many little screws and wing nuts, with almost no good way to hold it together during the process.Secondly, and more importantly, it is flimsy and cheap. The middle supports were bending just as we were maneuvering it empty. Then, when we began to fill it they all bent and are completely shot. All the sides are bowing in werid directions and overall illustrations I am concerned it will not hold dirt for more than a year. If the center supports where much stronger, I feel the sides wouldn't bow as much.For the price of this one compared to others I expected a much sturdier unit. BUYER BEWARE! Look elsewhere.\n",

The side walls are bulging out already. (See pic)It arrived well packaged and no damage in transit. Actually well done here.The metal materials are weakly constructed.Put it together exactly as the instructions stated. Filled it several inches (short of the top edge) with premium bagged potting soil. Done by hand and not compressed.Within a few days the side walls are bulging out. You see a steel rod on the picture which is perfectly straight and parts of the wall are touching while parts of the wall are about an inch away from touching the straight steel rod. (This is a harded steel ground rod which doesn't bend without a lot of pressure. )It was assembled on a level and tilled ground. I expect a lil flex from any bed after a season or 2. Not inside the first week.Im so mad that normally id return an item of this low quality. This one has been set up, filled with soil, irrigation,and planted. Otherwise id be sending it right back.

The middle brackets are very cheap and easily bend. They don't support any weight at all. The paint scratches very easily, so expect anything that hits it to scratch it. On the other hand, it does look nice once it's up. Obviously, it's big if you buy the 8ft one as I did and has a lot of room to fill.

For example it is important, though not immediately obvious, that the four corner pieces are oriented so the holes for the stability pegs are all down. There is no mention if the cross supports should be oriented up or down, though it may not matter unless they may rust faster facing up. Very nice to have wing nuts for the 80 screws used. The four stability pegs are so short I am not sure they accomplish anything, but don't see necessary anyway since the metal framework is so heavy once assembled. Very nice looking once together.\n",

      "Review text: I assembled this with my daughter, and it took about 60 minutes from start to finish.  I had to to remove bolts and backtrack a bit because I didn't notice that two corners were upside down -- the holes for the stakes go in the bottom and I didn't even notice that the holes existed in the first place.  A good chunk of the 60 minutes were spent removing the plastic coating from the panels!Anyway, it was fairly easy to build but you will be doing a lot of crouching.  It feels a little wobbly, especially when you are carrying it to the destination, but it feels far more solid once the soil has been added.  Speaking of soil, it takes a LOT to fill this thing up.  I mitigated this somewhat by disassembling the old cedar raised bed which was being replaced and putting the contents of that in the bottom of the new raised bed, but it took four trips to the recycling center to get enough soil to fill it to an acceptable level.I like that it's deep enough to grow carrots in and tall enough to keep rabbits away from green beans.  Here's to hoping that the metal lasts a long time!\n",

The assembly is not difficult, but far more time consuming than the 45 - 60 minutes the instructions suggest.  The twisting/tightening of so many wingnuts is very hard on your thumbs.  If you don't have access to a wingnut ratchet, then it may be easier & quicker to assemble if you switched out the wingnuts for bolts so you can use tools to tighten the connections.  The design is just like pictured in the ad.\n",

      "Review text: Pros:- Works as expected- Easy to put together- I got all the parts I needed (others report that they did not)- 2 feet deep- Cheaper than the other ones with this depth- About the same price as DIY but no need for a truckCons:- The support bars were the same as in the instruction manual- Pretty flimsy, I am not sure about its longevity- Prop 65 Warning (Although its a bit over used nowadays still concerning)- Paint scratches super easilyMine is currently working as expected, but I have only had it for a few days and have yet to fill it completely. Only threw in some fallen branches and grass cuttings. It went together really quickly.I wouldn't rest anything heavy on it, like bags of soil. I suspect it will bend it. The cross braces were a different shape entirely than in the instructions. I had to bend them so they would fit. They were easy to bend with my hands which begs the question of how useful they are.I compared the prices of these to a lot of other ones. I wanted a 1.5 to 2 feet of depth. I also tried to compare them to a DIY version. I think I got this for $160 and the DIY in my area would have been $119. I didn't have a truck and no rentals near me so I went with this one. The color is much better looking than a DIY one would look, but the paint scratches super easy. I probably could have painted a DIY one as well. If you are able, I would go with a DIY one so its a bit more sturdy.I will being buying a few more of these, if they don't break in the next few weeks.\n",

      "Review text: I am 100% pleased with these raised beds.  We bought 3 and they arrived within two days.  There is a little learning curve to get used to putting it together.  It was well packaged with each metal item protected with a light plastic covering.  Ours sat in an unheated garage so the plastic came of rather easily.  I started on the end with them lying down and pulled the plastic toward me.  It came off easily and for the most part in one sheet.  The nut, bolts and washers were shrink wrapped.  We put them in a box for ease of picking them up.  My husband and I worked as a team once we got the corners assembled. When we did the sides, I was on the outside with bolts, and he put on the washer and nut.  We tightened it up using a power drill and it went fast and easily.  The brackets helped to make it sturdier and so did using the power drill...it could be tightened up more.  I give these 100%!\n",

We scratched and swab tested for Lead with a negative result and ended up keeping them, but not without the testing and some discussion regarding the potential of poisoning ourselves.Also, all of the panels have a plastic film that takes as long to remove as to install all the fasteners and the plastic removal is not in the instructions.\n",

      "Review text: I am in the process of getting rid of all my garden containers and putting all my plants in raised gardens.  You can see the old black containers in the background of the image. The picture you see has three raised garden boxes. I didn't know what to get, so I bought a 1 foot, 1 1/2 foot, and 2 foot tall raised garden boxes. All of the boxes are 4 foot by 8 foot in size. The two gray raised garden boxes are the ANLEOLIFE boxes.  The tan garden box in the back was from another company.  The ANLEOLIFE boxes were of much thicker steel than the other companies box.  Now I paid twice as much for the ANLOELIFE boxes, but they seem worth it to me. All the bolts and wing nuts were included, and they were galvanized.  Everything went together nicely. I will have to wait to use them to see which of the two ANLEOLIFE boxes I like the most. The 2 foot tall one requires less bending, but it takes a lot of dirt to fill up. It's also oval shaped, so you loose a little planting space.  The 1 1/2 foot tall model seems to be a happy medium between the shorter and taller garden boxes. It does have center bracing that should help from making the box bow out.  The oval box does not have center bracing.  It's shape probably makes up for it, and I am not worried about it at this time.  I'm hoping to get a few years use out of these boxes.  Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and look forward to getting my garden going.\n",

      "Review text: This raised garden bed is sturdy once assembled, but it is quite a pain to put together. There are 10 panels that need to be attached, each with 8 screws with a wingnut on the inside. So 80 screws total, which is a lot! That being said, all those screws is what makes is so sturdy, which it needs to be to hold all the dirt and plants you'll be putting in it. Pic shows it partially completed, if you are assembling it by yourself you will probably not want to do it all at once.Cosmetically, it looks nice. I like that it is painted and not just bare metal. It comes in protective packaging, although one of my pieces has some paint scraped off that must've happened at the factory. Fortunately the metal underneath is galvanized, so it still shouldn't rust. I live in an area that gets lots of precipitation, so I will be putting that to the test!\n",

      "Review text: I'm a 60 year old lady and it was easy to put together myself.  The top and bottom edge are rolled so there are no sharp edges on the top or the need for a protective cover that will fall apart over time.I added two threaded 1/4\" rods in the center just in case it started to bulge with the weight of the soil.  No one has mentioned this in the reviews but I didn't want to have to empty it to fix the problem.  If you do this you will need a 1/4\" coupling and a \"standard\" screw and washer as the ones that come with it are metric.I placed stumps and thick branches in the bottom then twigs, leaves and grass.  I'll fill the top with soil so it doesn't cost so much fill.Very happy with the product.\n",

The approximately 9 million screws that hold it together could stand to be of higher quality, but they do the job. Some are showing signs of rust after a few weeks, but for half the price of competing beds they are a fantastic value. Sheet metal feels sturdy & has a good finish.\n",

No big deal - just what it is.Great to have instructions clearly written in English vs all pictograms. Do not believe what they say is assembly time. Need to at least double it. I built two and the second one was no faster.Be sure to have area level as that can really throw off how it sits. Unless I missed it, they should detail how much material is required to fill. It is about 1.5 cubic yards. Once filled, walls appear to hold their integrity. This would benefit from coming with rubberized strips for the top rims. I created my own.Beyond that, not much else to add. Seems to be worthwhile purchase.\n",

I bought two. First round: took me three hours. I disregarded other reviews that said only fasten them finger tight. I thought, I don't want to go back and have to fully tighten every single one of them.... I WAS WRONG! DO NOT make this mistake.Also the instructions have you put together the ends first (I bought the 6x3) and I thought hey its 6x3, all the sides will be the same length. NOPE. It comes with 4 side wall pieces and 2 end pieces. They are not labeled.Anyway, I had so many issues with the first round that I almost didn't build the second one. But I thought I might as well because the top soil is coming tomorrow.Second round I build the side walls first, and only tightened them finger tight. Then I added in the cross bars that help support the sides. Then I built the end walls. I stood the side walls upright and put the end wall on top and tightened it finger tight. Then I flipped it and put the other end wall on. It all went together pretty smoothly and only took me about an hour and a half. (I used an electric screw driver the second time around. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT. )I like them both. The first looks a little jacked up. But it'll work. Lesson learned. My third one is coming in a few days. This time, I am prepared.\n",

      "Review text: We love these gardening beds! We started out by buying a couple of the 8x4x2 and one of the 8x4x2, but liked them so much we ordered more. We now have 8 ---- 4 of each size. They were easy to construct and come not only with the needed hardware, but also with stakes to secure them to the ground. We briefly considered making our beds from lumber, but not only would they have been 2-3x more expensive, but living in a wet climate would greatly reduce their life expectancy. Now with these galvanized beds I imagine they will outlive us ;) We also like the fact that we can amend the soil and enhance it from what we would have gotten had we just planted straight into the ground. So we definitely recommend them ---- easy to assemble, long life expectancy, and the ability to enjoy richer, better planting soil.\n",

I am looking into ways to help limit the damage but I'm not sure what that looks like yet.This bed, like all projects takes a little bit of time and making sure you read the instructions from start to finish.  One mistake we made, although its not a big deal, was that we put the support sides upside so that the stake holes were on the top and not the bottom.  But, after you fill this bad boy with dirt its not going anywhere anyways.  Also be prepared to spend some time and money filling this thing up.  We filled about the bottom 6 to 8 inches with compost from our yard and rest with top soil and miracle grow.  This is basically a one time investment though and not a big deal.  After that we got some things planted and couldn't be happier.  There will probably come a time when we buy a second one.\n",

I used pliers and a power drill during assembly and it sped up the process considerably.  I put it together in two, hour long shifts, so 2 hours total by myself.  It was then also easily transportable from the driveway out into the backyard.  I just stood in the center and carried it from where the upper brace meets the walls.  We had our landscaper provide two yards of garden soil so that we didn’t need to purchase 100 bags from the garden center.  This container of filled to the brim would hold nearly 3 yards of dirt.  We will likely purchase another one of these next year, too!\n",

      "Review text: I mean it. \"Tin\" cuts are even worse than paper cuts.Very well packaged with no possibility of loss or damage.The instructions are brief but the diagrams help and it's not all that difficult to figure out at all.Be prepared for assembly to take a long time - 80 nuts and 80 bolts need to meet each other through either a panel+a bracket or 2 panels+2 brackets.Luckily, the holes are all drilled accurately so the only thing that occasionally makes insertion a little harder is the natural flexibility of the whole construction until you have all the parts connected and supported in place, at which point you get to go round all 80 connection points once more in order to tighten them up.The sharp edges only come into play if you are trying to put this together on your own.  If you have a second person to hold the side panels steady, bolting on a corner piece or joining two panels together would be a whole lot easier on fingers and knuckles.I love that this is 2 feet deep. I have filled the bottom 1ft with rotting firewood left over from Hurricane Sandy, a few fallen and partially decomposed leaves, horse poop and wood chips. Stuff that was just lying around. By the time I've filled it with good topsoil, I'll have a 64 square foot raised garden that has it's own heating and nutrient production in the \"basement\".\n",

I am on blood thinner and had to be VERY careful not to cut myself when assembling this. BTW that took me almost two hours - I kept dropping the small bolts or nuts and had to find where they had rolled.  The box and pacing are neatly designed, but I am sure some prefab work could have been done by manufacturer to shorten the assembly time for the purchaser. This unit does have a rolled upper edge which is better for safety, but the connector plates are like razors. My grandson bumped into a corner edge and it punctured and deeply cut his leg. If it had been me, that could have been a disaster. I am trying to figure out something that will cover all the sharp edges and prevent future cuts.

It’s very tedious putting together all the nuts & bolts and holding wall in alignment was a little tricky at times.  We completely filled it with real dirt. We did not buy expensive bagged soil therefore it was a much heavier fill. The center did bulge out some. I’d suggest to the company to put one more brace in the center walls to give more support in side walls.I am really glad I got the 2’ high container. Really nice having it that height. And the 4’x8’ length & width is a perfect size!I am happy to have it & hope it will give me many years of enjoyment in gardening.\n",

      "Review text: I was very concerned about the edges being sharp on these beds because I have small children. They arrived with gloves to protect your hands during assembly. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the exposed edges appear to be rolled. They aren’t round; they’re thin, but they are not sharp at all. It took two people about an hour to assemble each bed. I definitely look forward to adding more next year.\n",

      "Review text: First, assembly instructions are poorly written but we deciphered them successfully only to find that it really doesn't perform very well.  After filling it with soil, to a level about 4 to 6 inches below the top we found that the sides bulge outward at the side seams with a disturbing appearance.  The side is in two pieces with very little overlap, and the strength of the reinforcement isn't adequate by itself and there is only two cross braces between the side reinforcements (one at the very bottom and one at the very top).  I will now have to remove a good deal of soil away from sides and beef up the side reinforcements with angle iron and probably put a cable with a turnbuckle between the sides at mid height.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR A 2 FOOT HIGH RAISED GARDEN, but if you do buy it then plan on reinforcing the side seams at mid height before filling with soil.\n",

The directions are fairly simple to follow. Definitely a two person project if you want it done correctly. We will follow-up with pictures and more reviews as we see how it holds up during the winter rainy weather. As of this moment, we would make this purchase of a Frizione Garden Bed again.\n",

      "Review text: The only good thing about this is that it holds dirt. Assembly is awful. As other reviewers have pointed out the screws just aren't long enough. They work but it takes awhile for them to grab. Also it bulges at the joints on the long side. Not very attractive looking. We bought two of these and noticed they don't have the same dimensions. I haven't measured yet but looking at them side by side it's very obvious. I was also not impressed with shipping. I bought both of them the same day and one was a few days late. There is no reason that should have happened, other than their choice of shipping with the post office. I wouldn't buy this again. We bought some others that are a different brand and smaller and they are built much better. Look elsewhere for a raised bed. I wish I had.\n",

The screws in the middle where you use the longer screws that have to go into two brackets is a major pain in the butt, the screws are too short and this part takes about an hour and you will need another person to push on the other side so you can get a screw started.I noticed if you put any weight on the thing it folds up like an aluminum can.\n",

With grocery prices climbing this unit will pay for itself quickly.  Less expensive then building with wood tho we will probably add wood trim around it to match other landscaping.

      "Review text: We needed a solution for the front of our house. There is a short retaining wall along the sidewalk that runs across the front of our house. A raised bed would be easy to plant and maintain, and would  plan allow the plantings to be easier to see as they would be two feet higher than the ground.  The 4ft wide by 8ft long (2 feet high) looks to be ideal.The box included ten section which were easy to put together, two straight panels on each side and three curves for each end. I would recommend you use an electric drill or impact driver rather than a standard screw driver or the little screw driver that came with it. Because of the shape of the horizontal ridges, you do not need a wrench to hold the nut. Using your fingers to hold the nut while running an impact driver was the best approach.The holes for each panel are drilled with precision so there was not wrestling to get all the screws and nuts in place. And while the edges of the panels are sharp, the top and bottom edges (the parts you grab with you hands when putting in place) have rounded edges. For safety's sake, the box included gloves which you could use when unpacking or carrying. I did not use them.Next step will be filling the raised bed with organic material, top soil and them plants. Looks to be an ideal solution and well made.\n",

      "Review text: First, I want to say that I got this for 119$. I find this to be a fair price for a bed of this size. I would not buy it for 175$ or whatever price that is higher than 119$. Why? Because for a few bucks more, I could get a 32 inch version that has paint protecting. These are bare metal which I do assume will last quite a few years, I hardly expect to last longer than the aforementioned.That being said. This bed is great. It's very thick and heavy steel. You can treat it yourself if you're worried about rust which will cost extra money but give you the same results as one that is already painted.The only reason I took stars off is due to that reason and the price without coupon. If I were going to consider this at full price, I would just go one step better and grab the painted ones.This also does not come with rubber edging which in my opinion, is needed. These get very hot in the summer to the touch also again, because it's not painted.So, do I recommend these? That is a resounding yes IF you get them for around 119$. Otherwise, I would not recommend them for the reasons already mentioned. 24 inches is a pretty perfect height for gardening and should keep a lot of unwanted animals out.\n",

      "Review text: This item has a lot of sharp metal and pieces. When I received mine it was beat up pretty bad and parts everywhere in the box. They give you a pair of gloves but I didn't see them because they were trapped in between some corner panels. I would strongly recommend using them or Kevlar gloves of your own. Assembly is fairly easy , literally 1/2 a page, and pretty easy to figure out once you get started. It is probably best to assemble close or where you are going to put it. Even though the metal is thin it is pretty sturdy and looks good. I have to wait another 4 weeks before I can start any of my plants outside but this will look nice where I am putting it. This raise bed is a solid buy if you need to contain a garden.\n",

      "Review text: I just got these March 2023 so I can't speak to longevity. They did arrive with all parts needed and directions. One box appeared to be returned and then sent to me as the bag of parts was cut open and spilled all over. Those panels were the dented ones shown in the photo as well. The dents are at the bottom of the panels so I'm not going to notice them ever again now that they're outside. Disappointing, yes. Enough to send back, no. My 10 year old built both (I bought two 8x4 beds) of these himself and the support bars in the middle kept them very sturdy to carry outside and set up. The metal is covered in a protective film to keep everything from scratching up during delivery and assembly. The one thing I am disappointed in, though I do know it's the way Amazon works, is that I paid $80 for each bed and right after they lowered the price to $66 a piece. I really hate that.\n",

Be advised that the metal is very thin and can be easily bent, and the finish is easily scratched so handle with care!  All the pieces come with a plastic film for protection during shipping.  Pealing the film back from the ends of the panels just a couple of inches during the assembly process will help protect the panels until the unit is in its final position. Then remove the film completely as your final set.\n",

      "Review text: This will be our first year working with a garden box in our backyard in Washington State. The garden box arrived quickly, and everything was packaged well with simple-to-read assembly instructions. We assembled it in the kitchen and carried it out to the backyard when it was assembled. That made it easier to do on a flat surface. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, and the included gloves were great to protect hands in the process. We kept the protective coating on the panels until after it was assembled and placed outside. This prevented any scratching during assembly. The parts all fit together nicely and now that is in place, I believe that it will last for many years.\n",

      "Review text: You are probably thinking; the product didn't work but 5 stars? In fact the raised garden bed was not able to hold a full load of watered garden soil without bowing out at the sides. If I were going to grow veggies with shallow roots I could put yard waste, mulch, etc. in the bottom and garden soil on the top several inches. Doing this the bed would be fine. But that is not what I wanted for deep root crops (potato, carrot, beets, etc.) so I decided to return the raised garden bed. The seller (Brandline) backed their product 100% and has excellent customer service. It's easy to give five stars when a transaction goes well but when I explained the situation Brandline stepped up and provided a solution that worked out for both of us.  That's why they get five stars from me. You can buy with confidence from Brandline. I will be doing more business with them in the future.\n",

      "Review text: This raised garden was fairly easy to build. My husband and 8 year old daughter put it together. I love the height of it. It makes it much easier to access the plants for thinning and I'm sure it will make it easier for picking when the vegetables are ready to harvest. I've done much smaller raised beds in the past made from wood and they rotted, had lots of weeds, and you still had to bend down to get to the garden. Not with this one.  So happy with this garden bed so far.\n",

I opened this package and they were in fine condition except they were silver not the dark gray I ordered.

If buying for myself, I'll buy cedar everytime. 129. vs 589. My budget was 400.00. Bought 4 boxes, 2 sizes.Thin metal, 72 screw holes, design flaw doesnt come close to how bad these are. tedious, some sharp edges, not a straight forward assembly. Lining up panels, with screw holes, with correct depth and you will not know if everything is lined up until a row of screws are in. This will assemble with one up to four corner sides screwed but the other edges won't line up.  Regrettable purchase. Returning an unused bed required a 78.00 restock fee. I came close to removing them and refunding the homeowner.  The property was prepared for sale. The saying buy cheap buy twice about this product couldn't be any more accurate than if the author of the quote designed these traps themselves.Step back three steps, slowly turn around, close your eyes and run. Poke your eyes out if you buy them, then you can give the headache of assembling these to anyone else. Seriously, trash!\n",

      "Review text: So to start this whole thing took over a month but in the end I will say the company did make it right.I am however writing this review to warm people who may be fooled how I was. The listing says the bed is 8x4x2 after that it then says its 22\" the bed is not 24\" tall as advertised and I was informed by the company this is to \"make it easier for customers to find\" That is bologna. The bed is not 2 ft tall and if you are putting it in a garden full of 2ft tall beds it is very noticeable. As an attempt to fix this issue I was sent out another bed. The second bed of course was also not 2ft tall but it also had paint issues and rust when I opened the box. I ended up throwing the bed away as I live in south Florida and the sun and humidity is not kind to anything.That being said after over a month of back and forth I was given back my money.Now here is the hard part. The one bed I do have is amazing. The build quality the strength everything. Its one of my favorite beds in my entire garden, but lying about its size and then sending me a rusty bubbled bed was sadly enough for me to look elsewhere for my raised beds.If you are looking for raised beds and do not care if they are 24\" tall then these are an incredible option I really wish it was the right height. I will say though check your beds when you get them, you may also get one with bubbling paint and starting to rust and for me its unacceptable for something that is supposed to live its entire life outside. As long as the height doesn't matter to you and you are conscious that it may have some manufacturer defect I would recommend these beds. They are well built easy to assemble and sturdy as all get out once built and filled. I really wish I hadn't had these issues because I would love to make my entire new garden out of these beds I absolutely love the way they look.\n",

      "Review text: My plan to upgrade my garden this year included purchasing 3 of these raised beds.  I just started putting them together recently and realized the size is off.  Instead of 8ft long they are only 7.6 ft long, which I'm not happy about.Otherwise, the ease of putting these together is pretty straightforward once you figure it out.  I couldn't find instructions in the box of the first one I was putting together so studied pictures from others who have reviewed.  Of course after putting the first one together and getting rid of the box I discovered the instructions sheet.  It appears to gave been slid into box after packaging so it wasn't visible when I opened the box FLAT on the ground.  There are a TON of screws so this takes time.  I suggest getting them started by hand then firming up with electric drill and rachet/plies to old the bolt.  I also did this by myself but putting sections together inside my garage then joining the larger sections out on my patio and using chairs and trashcan as support.I expect that once completed and filled with soil this will last for many years to come.\n",

      "Review text: I am very pleased with this bed.  Most raised beds are only 1' tall, but this one is 2' tall, which makes it suitable for deep root crops like carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and asparagus. The smaller beds were a lighter gauge steel, so they felt kind of flimsy, but the Land Guard bed is very sturdy, and the corners are strong. It is very well designed, and was easy to put together.  When you calculate cost per square foot of the smaller beds (6'x2'x1') compared to the Land Guard bed (8'x4'x2'), the cost per square foot of the Land Guard is about 1/4 the cost of the smaller bed, so you are getting a great value for the price, even though it seems more expensive.  I have bought 3 of them so far, and am considering buying another couple of them.  They are easy to reach without having to do much bending over, which is good for my back.  I fill the bottom (about 1/4 of the way full) with old branches and partially rotted tree trunks because it helps to retain water, and because I don't need to add as much soil (a cost savings).  The wood will break down and release nutrients over the next several years, and I'll only need to top the beds off with some compost to fill them up as the wood shrinks. Overall, it has been a great purchase.\n",

      "Review text: I read some reviews that said these boxes were flimsy, but I ordered 2 anyway because they're just going to sit on the ground and hold soil. I expected somewhat floppy sides, but these panels are almost as easy to dent as aluminum foil. That makes them incredibly awkward to assemble because they won't stand up. Also, the 97 screws required to put this nightmare together are very badly machined. As most DIYers know, assembling something with lots of fasteners is much easier if you put in the hardware hand tight first, and then tighten everything once it's together. Impossible with this box. Fully half the screws seize up after only one or two turns, and require tools from there. Also, the instructions are very limited, which was ok until it was time to attach the stabilizing bars. I'm not sure I did it right, and I know longer care. I don't know how I'm going to talk myself into burning another 2 hours to assemble the second one. You get what you pay for. These are cheap and will probably work for what I need, but I won't buy them again.\n",

They came packaged well, there was no damage and they actually went together pretty easy. They are a bit more flimsy then I was hoping but after reading other reviews I was ready for that. When I was using the shovel I slammed it down on the edge and it bent it pretty good so you need to be careful when using tools around it. I figure if I keep getting dents around the top I'll probobly just use some boards and make a top rail to go around them and make them look nice. They are a perfect height and plenty big, so if that is my only problem I'm good with that. Right now I have two but if I decide to get another I will be ordering another one of these.

The nuts and bolts makes a tight seal as you hold the square nut and use a screwdriver to tighten it.I love this so much. Its way better than wood, where it may rot in a few years. So this works really well. I check how much it would cost for a DIY. Materials based of a youtube video I watched came out to about $100.

      "Review text: Great, sturdy, attractive raised beds for vegetable gardening!After running out of space for raised beds and pots on my deck, I wanted to expand and add some ground-based raised beds for this year. I liked the style and concept of these types of galvanized metal raised beds and had seen them used in the gardens of some popular gardening channels on YouTube/TikTok over the past few years and always wanted some. The ones advertised on those channels, however, were at least twice the cost of these, and after digging into the details on both, they are effectively the same, apart from color options, which I didn't feel was worth paying twice as much for. I appreciate the solid construction and material, and I'm sure they will last many seasons. I also appreciate that they're food safe for vegetable and herb gardening. Overall, these seem like a good value for what they are, and I'll likely buy more as I find more places to put them.\n",

The bed is taller than you will think, and it takes more than 2 cubic yards of soil (2.3 I think to be exact), so expect to haul a lot of soil to fill it. I would buy another one, unfortunately, it's always out of stock.\n",

Very disappointed since I purposefully got the 8-ft section to fill in an area in the yard.\n",

      "Review text: The price is good considering you don't need to drill, cut, or bend sheet metal :-) It's not likely going to last a hundred years, but nothing does anymore. The panels have nice folded edges top and bottom so it's not sharp. The corner brackets have some sharp edges- its sheet metal- so be careful on those. It is a few inches shorter than shown in the picture but close enough for my needs.The panels have 8 drilled holes on each end and comes with a bunch of little bolts and square nuts to put it together. Center uses support rods. The  center uses a bolt and square nut starting at the top hole then the next hole uses a support rod then the following hole uses bolt and square nut, etc.It is easier to put together if you have a helper. If you have work gloves, recommend use them for sharp edges. If no helper, then have at least something you can lean a side panel on while connecting end pieces - that's what I did. The polished metal looks nice. But I might put some paint on it to blend in better with my area.Some if the corners were a little bent during shipping. But I easily straightened them with small pliers. And the corners anyway hide behind the corner brackets.\n",

These are huge! 4 raised beds took approximately 5 ton of top soil even loading them stumps and wood. I topped it with a potting soil as well. These are so easy to put together and I built them in the comfort of my garage. Then carried them by myself to the garden area. Can't wait for the victory garden to start producing.\n",

Plan on screwing together about a 100 nuts and bolts.  The metal is also very flimsy, sharp and hard to handle.  I was able to put the second unit together much faster after the first.

Years of debating led me to eventually muster the nerve to place my order, and I'm pleased I did.Galvanized metal is weather resistant and has a long lifespan. The kit is simple to put together. I value its size, which gives me enough room to cultivate a variety of veggies. The location I chose was a little damp and accumulates water when it rains, therefore one of the primary reasons I was searching for a bed with a little more height was for improved drainage.This is a good buy for anyone who is serious about gardening and should take it as a long-term investment, in my opinion.\n",

Doesn't look like packaging would have prevented that, warehouse 'deal' or not. Not difficult to assemble. First I had to grab pliers, hammers, etc. to straighten out the corners of the panels. When assembling, start with a panel and corner piece, then work around. Helpful to have stakes to hold up panels if going it alone. Do not tighten until all screws/crossbars in place. Happy with finished product. Be warned - width and depth measurements are somewhat accurate, but length is closer to 92\" inches overall.\n",

We liked it so much we bought another in April 2023 using the \"Buy Another\" in our order history.The one we received this year was painted with silver spray paint. Only the nuts and bolts were galvanized.  Also the fastener design in the center was changed. Finally, it no longer includes the tie-down stakes that the original one we bought came with.The two appear the same, but the lack of zinc plating (galvanized) on the new one's metal will likely lead to rusting.I will post more pictures in a few months to compare how each are holding up to the weather.\n",

However, one plus to this super thin material is the corners bent back with my bare hands, so at least I can still use it. Use caution because the edges are sharp. Instructions are lacking, but you can figure it out eventually. I won’t buy again or recommend, but it’s good enough to not pay to ship it back.\n",

      "Review text: I have a number of garden beds setup since they are conveniently placed near my patio area and allow me to grow various fresh vegetables.  I recently acquired this galvanized bed which is twice as wide as my other beds so I'll be able to grow more tomatoes!The Raised Garden Bed Planter is easy to build using the provided hardware.  A Philips screwdriver and adjustable wrench was needed to tighten up the bolts.  The kit comes with easy-to-follow instructions with everything diagrammed.  The parts that make up the bed are individually marked.The bed comes with three center cross-rods to provide strength.  And each corner is covered by a plastic cap.Once placed in a suitable location the corners can be \"staked\" to the ground using the four supplied corner stakes.  These fit through the galvanized corners and stop the bed from moving around.  Once put together, fill with your favorite mix of growing materials.In my kit I found a pair of gloves as a bonus.The kit itself is very compact when stored.  I look forward to many years of fruitful growing!\n",

Galvanized steel to prevent rust and insure long life; reinforced supports at the middle to hold the whole thing together; rolled tops/bottoms so you don't slice an arm off and very simple assembly (ok I goofed) that can be completed by one person by him/herself.  At $86 it's cheaper than others that are about half the size.  Large enough to grow a significant vegetable patch.  For this one I plan to plant okra, 3 rows of 7 plants each.

Be aware your soil to fill it will cost more than the bed. 24 cubic feet in there now and it could still handle 4 to 6 more. Used cheap painters plastic tarp to line bottom for weed prevention. Used mainly as seedling staging area, radishes, & posies for the ladies. Will be getting more of them. 100% positive review here.\n",

      "Review text: These went together very easily. Although the instruction sheet is kind of vague. As long as you are good interpreting illustrations you should be fine. But there isn’t any text instructions. They even include a pair of cotton gloves to protect your hands from sharp edges of the metal. It’s very sturdy after putting it together. They only thing that’s unknown at this point is how long they will last. Supposedly they are made of galvanized steel and should be resistant to rust. But we will see.\n",

This particular raised bed has a strong, rigid designed structure that will not bend or collapse when I fill it with soil because it has 4 full strength stabilizers bars that helps to hold the unit together. Great product that's reasonably priced and can provide me with a lifetime of growing countless vegetables, fruits and herbs and thats truly a thing of beauty.\n",

      "Review text: I wanted to build wood garden beds for a vegetable garden but with soaring lumber prices we needed a more economical option. These garden beds worked perfectly. I love the dark wood look and that they'll last much longer than real wood! Bought two 8x4 ft beds for planting vegetables and was so happy with those that I bought a 4x4 ft bed to plant herbs.I put all three garden beds together by myself without any big issues. The set comes with screws, wingnuts, and washers. I screwed the screw and wingnut together with my hands and then used a screwgun and a pair of pliers to tighten everything together. I highly recommend wearing some thick gloves, pants, and closed-toed shoes because the metal pieces have super sharp edges that will cut you if you're not careful. Also, each metal piece is covered with a thin layer of plastic. Make sure you peel the plastic off before screwing the pieces together!Overall, I love the quality of these garden beds and you really can't beat the price!\n",

Easily put together by hand with one person (however it would be faster with two) but, the draw back was the lip of the bed where twisting bolts go, needed to be bent upward in order to secure.

      "Review text: This is a great raised bed! I put it together in about an hour (while chatting with 2 teenagers who were sitting in chairs watching me - haha). Very simple directions, only a few parts to assemble, but LOTS of screws. 72 to be exact. It was straight forward instructions and assembly. The directions say to use a drill, but I only needed a screwdriver to tighten after everything was assembled. Mostly just hand tightening needed. It came with white cloth gloves that were handy as I did cut myself on the metal before being safe and putting the gloves on. It is flimsy until you fill with your choice of filler, but that's to be expected with a bottomless and metal raised bed. Once I filled with wood and soil, it is sturdy as a rock and looks great! Overall, very satisfied!\n",

The only BIG issue I had were the pieces that join together the walls were very VERY stuck together. I had to get help from my dad to get them apart safely and not ruin them. I also thought this would be an easy issue to fix? Possibly putting a piece of packaging to keep them from resting into place. One other issue, is the packaging is very low waste, which is great for me, but could be bad for other shoppers who have rough delivery people. And this is also why I think the joint pieces got stuck? I like this garden bed a lot though! I hope it lasts me a very long time :)\n",

However, it took hours to assemble (despite the instructions claiming a 30-minute assembly). Each piece of metal siding was coated in plastic that was bubbling up everywhere. The plastic had to be peeled off which was extremely tedious, as it would not peel off in large pieces. This bed was not worth the cost - others on the market are cheaper, look just as nice, and are much easier to assemble.\n",

We're very pleased with the quality of the planter box. The rolled edges add strength and greatly reduce the risk of scraps or cuts.

There are 48 washers that have to be separated from each other, 48 screws about 1/2 inch long and 48 nuts. More than half have to be assembled into a slotted sheet metal. The average person doesn’t have fingers the size of a 10 yr old, which is required for the screws that fit into the slotted areas. I bought 2 units. The first unit took me almost 3 Hours to assemble, the second just under 2 hrs. I also used an electric screwdriver to help me along. 30 minutes to assemble by the average person is total crap. Other then that the units are fine.\n",

      "Review text: After looking at a variety of various raised bed products on Amazon, I decided to go with this one primarily because I liked the faux wood finish and the sturdy construction. These were very easy to assemble and look really nice in the yard. There's only one feature that I don't particularly care for, but it shouldn't be noticeable once the bed is full of plants. To preserve the faux wood finish, the sheets of metal come with a protective plastic covering, which I believe is intended to stay on the product (versus just for shipping purposes). On both raised beds that I purchased, there are lots of areas along the top edge where the plastic has bubbled or peeled, but it is not visible on the majority of the product. Since it is only noticeable on the top edges that will eventually be covered with plant foliage, I'm still very happy with the products themselves.\n",

      "Review text: So, this is bed number 3 I ordered.  First thing I don't understand is how they say use gloves and actually provide you a pair when the screws, washers and bolts are so small that is almost an impossibility.  So that made putting it together a little difficult to put together.  I thought the directions were very simple to understand yet the timeframes they give you on putting these together is ridiculous.  This one is much sturdier yet some pieces were bent and/or damaged yet box was not damaged.  I would like to see bigger hardware to simplify and speed up the assembly.  I do like the fact that is has a lip around the top and bottom, especially the top and the cross braces seem to be a lot sturdier.  They should include a couple more of them.  Bed 1 and this one are in the running yet still looking at others hoping to find one that is sturdy, simple to assemble.  I always put cardboard down in these beds first and some flakes of old crappy hay.  Then added top soil/compost/manure.  This one took14 1 cu. ft bags yet will need more once it settles down.  Wanted to include some peat moss yet everyone seems to be out of stock on that one.  I would recommend purchasing this bed because of its sturdiness.  HAPPY PLANTING EVERYONE.\n",

The support poles come already bent into a L-shape on the ends. I remedied this by purchasing 6 mending brackets with hardware, straightening out the poles and installing the poles again. Voila! It’s a rectangle now. The supplier should take note of this and provide what’s needed to fully set up. The poles are the correct length only if they’re straight instead of bent. Either lengthen your support poles or supply the additional hardware needed. It might prevent returns which is very difficult with something of this size.\n",

Rods were not wrapped, and the cardboard that was suppose to secure it was in the box. Screwdriver provided is too small for screws. Flat panels require some finagling to get them to fit. Secure top screw and then flex the panel to align the bottom holes. Then all the other screws should be easy to secure. Sad I paid full price for a returned product. If it was less than $100 I wouldn’t feel so bad…\n",

      "Review text: The media could not be loaded.                  *THIS TAKES TWO PEOPLE for assembly because each part is quite wobbly and like other reviewers, the holes definitely DO NOT line up symmetrically. So what we did was have one person on one side line up panel holes as close as possible & hold them, while the other person inserted the screw, and used the screwdriver to hold it in while the person opposite screwed the wing nut down. We lined up first top/bottom holes then pushed and pulled to do the rest... we found this was most efficient after arguing and cussing with the first two panels. Once we figured out what to do as partners, it went fairly fast but still took a couple hours to fully assemble. Once we got it together, we were quite happy with appearance and with proper underlayment of rocks, etc. feel it will be quite secure beautiful raised garden bed.PROS:Sizing and height was exactly what I was looking for. 2ft height is a great size for a WHEELCHAIR ♿️ bound person or someone needing to sit and garden.8 foot X 4 foot is a great size for our small garden.Rounded edges are nice with the rubber capping for protection.CONS:• holes misaligned, some very badly. You need to pull, push, bend paneling a bit and must work with a partner.•paint very thin easily scratched. There is plastic that covers the painted side if the panels but if you leave it on, you will have a very ugly tattered looking paneling after a while. Scratches can be covered up with touch up paint.\n",

It took 45 minutes for three of us to assemble. It helps to have an electric drill to help tighten all the screws. I especially liked the center supports on the 8 x 4 size. The top edge is rolled to prevent any sharp edges, but they also give you a heavy rubber trim piece to head to the top. Absolutely no complaints.

      "Review text: I have bought cheaper raised beds, but I have never been really impressed. This one impressed me. There were clear instructions, the exact number and type of screws included (even had a screwdriver and 2 pairs of garden gloves), but best of all was the quality of material. I will have this for a long time.\n",

      "Review text: Great quality for the price,  easy to put together. The wing nuts made a huge difference in the ease. There were a few bolts that had a burr and didn't work,  but all in all I was able to set these up with my 2 nephews 9 & 13. We knocked out 4 and they look great! 4 stars because of a few of the bolts wouldn't work,  we ended up using longer ones (there were extra of those,  but I ordered a shorter 1 foot tall bed and I'm not certain if they all come with extra? ) all in all I like them!\n",

      "Review text: I just finished assembling the second one of these (6x3x2) planters. The first one took four hours. I was hopeful that the second would go faster, but it was still about the same time. I did both of them by myself. In the reviews people speak of holes not aligning. In general they don’t. Most of the problems are with side panels that become somewhat flattened during shipping. I found that if you do the top and bottom screws first, then the middle, that the rest will slip right in. Now, it’s not always trivial to get the top and bottom done and someone to help would make it much easier, but it can be done! Just a note, they give you gloves, but you really can’t wear them while you install screws and the unfinished edges are really sharp! (Yes, I did manage to cut myself!)The other thing that I would like to point out is that the assembled containers are very large and that they require a huge amount of solid material to fill them. I’m talking about 30 cubic feet or so! At typical prices you should figure more than $100 worth of filler, each! (Maybe more!)The finished product is attractive and very functional and I can recommend them, but be warned about the assembly and the cost of filling them.\n",

      "Review text: This bed is bigger than expected, but I'm pleased. In the background you can see the smaller bed I ordered earlier. It was smaller than expected, so that's why I ordered the larger one. Both were easy to assemble. I was able to assemble them alone. However, that said the larger one does come with instructions that I should have paid closer attention to.  It comes with two different sizes of bolts, which I discovered after having it partially finished. I had replace the  bolts I'd used, but that was my error. I'm very excited to begin gardening. I would definitely buy these again.\n",

I’ve only had them up for a month and a half but so far they are holding up great! I filled the bottom with twigs, leaves, grass clippings, peat moss, and straw so I wouldn’t have to purchase so much soil. Then I did a mixture of topsoil and raised bed potting mix for the top. I did about a foot of soil and the rest was compost. So far it’s working out great! My plants are growing larger than ever this year! Now if only I could keep out the dang squirrels!!\n",

      "Review text: First off I have to say that one person can't assemble this in 30 minutes (as the instructions state). It took my husband longer even using an electric drill/screwdriver. Be very very careful as the edges are sharp - there are even gloves included to use while assembling.I think it's a bit expensive for what it is - essentially a few pieces of lightweight metal held together at the corners and with a cross beam to try to provide more stability.  I am thankful that I had earned some Amazon gift cards so it didn't feel as expensive.It's not yet installed in our yard as we need to do some digging to secure the planter box but I think it will be a good size for my first year of veggie garden\n",

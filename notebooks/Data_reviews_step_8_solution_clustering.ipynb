      "Title: Noise Reduction Solutions for Car Toy\n",
      "Objective: Reduce the noise produced by the car toy, which has led to user dissatisfaction and negatively impacted the product's perceived value and marketability.\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      "- Add a volume control feature that allows users to adjust the noise levels to their preference.\n",
      "- Review the internal components of the toy to identify the source of the noise and add noise-reducing materials like foam or rubber to the design.\n",
      "- Modify the design of the toy to reduce the sound produced when the toy is in use.\n",
      "Steps:\n",
      "- Volume Control: Add a control knob on the side of the toy that modifies the interaction between the toy's components, thus controlling the noise level.\n",
      "- Noise-Reducing Materials: Include foam or rubber materials inside the toy to lessen the impact noise made by the components.\n",
      "- Design Modification: Redesign the toy's components to reduce the sound produced when the toy is in use.\n",

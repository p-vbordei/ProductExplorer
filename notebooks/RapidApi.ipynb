It is a great starter garden, but if you are looking to replace your aero garden and are use to that level of interaction, this is not the machine for you. While this hydro-garden does grow plants, it is very basic with only two grow modes and no interactive system to let you know your garden status. For the price, however, it is an excellent starter garden for a kid or a purchase for someone that isnâ€™t quite ready to commit a lot of money to a name-brand top of the line hydro-garden. Like other people, I also had a problem with mold. Increasing the air flow with a fan and wiping it from the grow pods, helped a lot but did not totally solve the issue.\",\"reviewUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37D68T9EOX8K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1#R37D68T9EOX8K4\",\"total_found_helpful\":null,\"images\":[],\"variation\":{},\"videoUrl\":null},\"reviews\":[{\"stars\":5,\"date\":\"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 23, 2023\",\"verified_purchase\":true,\"manufacturer_replied\":false,\"username\":\"WishGigglesWishGiggles\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSH5TTSNEVKK22TJA7EFFQGHIWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8\",\"title\":\"growing well\",\"review\":\"it was a little slow starting, but then got going well.

I have been trying to wrap my head around why this thing is as highly reviewed as it is.The first picture is the side I fixed based on another customers review. The second is what the instructions told me to do.It took me two hours to assemble it first, and I quickly realized the instructions left out some really key details. I only discovered those details by watching other customer videos. The instructions are 1/5 stars.I left it alone, thinking Iâ€™d just use it as is for the summer. Within two days, the gap in instructions translated to the sides bowing and the gaps in the walls growing.Today I had to spend another hour moving around the dirt I filled it with so I could reconstruct the sides and not destroy what now seems like an overpriced unit.Iâ€™m really glad this worked for some people, but beware that it takes SIGNIFICANT elbow grease to assemble, you almost certainly need a rubber mallet (I bruised my hand from pounding pieces together), and you should not rely on the nonsensical instructions - watch customer video reviews for pointers. Maybe also plan to have a helper. It is NOT easy to assemble.If this wasnâ€™t already filled and the time to plant wasnâ€™t already upon me, I would return it. I have another raised bed that went together in 20 minutes and has held beautifully.

I did NOT read the reviews before I bought (which is a good thing b/c I prob wouldn\\'t have purchased if I had read about the difficulty assembling)...BUT WAIT... I have good news!  The first one took forever until I watched the video in between the first and second garden box assembly....and focused my attention to the 10mm you need to have spaced on each of the right and left sides when sliding on the metal sliders on top and bottom (this WILL make your life so much easier when assembling so PLEASE watch the video)...This is a great product for the price and especially if you need to buy more than one for lots of veggies.  Here\\'s the deal....the instructions say that you don\\'t need any tools...YOU DO.  You need a Rubber Mallet (for sure) and a drill and lots of screws (which they say is optional...IT\\'S NOT if you want this to last more than one season (screws will keep it lasting for years to come if you add enough of them (and I didn\\'t use the tiny screws they provide as an \"optional step\", I used longer sheet metal screws and pre drilled a hole before screwing the sheet metal ones in - make sure your predrill hole (use a drill bit that is thinner than the width of your screw).  Now for the real deal....Me and my dad (you need two people for this assembly) started off assembling the first one.  Took us 3 hours and after two bloody fingers from cuts (I didn\\'t wear the gloves they provided and learned my lesson the hard way - WEAR THE GLOVES even when taking out of the box as that was my first major injury.  The directions are not great and so that is why you should watch the video first.  it\\'s NOT easy to slide the metal bars on top and bottom so slide it on half way and use the rubber mallet to pound it the rest of the way (by having one person hold the side as you pound the slider in with the mallet) and pay very close attention to having equal inches of exposed aluminum on each of the left and right side!!!!  If you do this, assembly WILL only take you about half hour vs. my first attempt at over 3 hours.  Assemble the two long sides first before you attempt the corner brackets - and after it\\'s all assembled, I put in 4 sheet metal screws on each corner - 2 on top of corner piece and 2 on sides of the corner piece (through the metal and into the aluminum (need to go very slow with drill when working with metal as you predrill and put pressure with fingers underneath as you work thru metal and aluminum) - Then I added two screws on each long side pieces directly in the aluminum where the two pieces meet.  Now it is STURDY and ready for the weight of 10-12 bags of soil pressure - sorry for the long winded review but I just didn\\'t want someone else to feel like checking themselves into a looney bin after trying to assemble without knowing these facts  :)', 'reviewUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HLSBJ14R4EDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09MQ689XL', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2019', 'variation': {'Color': 'Dark Grey', 'Size': '68\"x36\"x12\"'}, 'videoUrl': None, 'manufacturer_replied': False, 'images': [], 'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    PLEASE READ before reading other reviews and making your decision', 'userUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJIR5KZB6HOT6ONESGBK6SYSVUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'stars': 4, 'total_found_helpful': 1012, 'username': 'shannon', 'verified_purchase': True}, {'review': \"Product works well, but the listing is Made in a way that is a little confusing, so I ended up buying the wrong size.

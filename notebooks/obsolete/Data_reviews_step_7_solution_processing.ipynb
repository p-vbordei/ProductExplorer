Instead of using a simple coating, which appears to wear off quickly, a comprehensive review of the pen design should be conducted. A shift towards a robust, wear-resistant material like high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or polycarbonate could provide a long-lasting solution. Additionally, considering a full-body design rather than a coated one could mitigate the issue of the coating coming off. This upgraded design should undergo rigorous testing to ensure it withstands regular use without significant wear or tear, ultimately prolonging the lifespan of the pen and enhancing customer satisfaction.\"},\\\n",

This feature would significantly enhance user convenience, as they will not have to source a replacement pen separately. However, to implement this, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to ensure that the additional production and packaging costs do not adversely affect the product's price point.

Finally, there have been suggestions to attach the pen to the board to prevent it from getting lost or misplaced.\",\"Solution 1\": {\"Title\": \"Reducing the Noise Level of the Magnetic Beads and Balls\",\"Description\": \"To address the issue of noise, the magnetic beads and balls could be coated with a sound-dampening material like rubber or silicone. This would reduce the clacking and rattling sounds, making the toy more suitable for quiet environments. However, this solution would increase the production cost, and a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to ensure that the added value justifies the increased cost. Additionally, the coating should not affect the magnetic properties of the beads and balls, and the product should undergo rigorous testing to ensure that it meets safety standards.\"},\"Solution 2\": {\"Title\": \"Designing a Mechanism to Prevent Magnetic Balls from Falling Back into Holes\",\"Description\": \"To prevent the magnetic balls from falling back into their holes, a mechanism could be incorporated into the product design. One possible solution is to use a spring-loaded mechanism that pushes the balls up and out of the holes when the stylus is removed. Another solution is to use a magnetic field that repels the balls when they get too close to the holes. Both of these solutions would require additional production costs, and a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to determine the most suitable option based on user needs, manufacturing feasibility, and cost implications.

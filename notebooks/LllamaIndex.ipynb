    "Design Philosophy: Progressive Disclosure of Complexity\n",
    "Progressive disclosure of complexity is a design philosophy that aims to strike a balance between the needs of beginners and experts. The idea is that you should give users the simplest and most straightforward interface or experience possible when they first encounter a system or product, but then gradually reveal more complexity and advanced features as users become more familiar with the system. This can help prevent users from feeling overwhelmed or intimidated by a system that seems too complex, while still giving experienced users the tools they need to accomplish advanced tasks.\n",
